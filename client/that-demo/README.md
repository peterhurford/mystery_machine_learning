This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built by [@saudapop](https://github.com/saudapop)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The api calls in the app point to relative endpoints. If you want to play around with the build in dev mode you'll need to prefix each endpoint with `https://mystery-machine-learning-api.herokuapp.com/`.

OR

If you would rather launch from the flask app, after you make changes just run `./build.sh` from the project root, it will make a new build and then launch the flask app.
