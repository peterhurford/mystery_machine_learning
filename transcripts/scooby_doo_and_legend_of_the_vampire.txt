Scene 1
(Somewhere in Australia, we see the Outback and then to a mountain called Vampire Rock. A stage and its spotlights are seen near the foot of the mountain, and we see a man with and his grandfather looking at the stage.)

Daniel Iliwara: (giving orders to a stagehand) A little to the left. Little more. Perfect.
Malcom Iliwara: Daniel, this concert is not a good idea.
Daniel Iliwara: Relax, grandfather. Everything will be fine. Come on, we're ready for Matt Marvelous' sound check. You'll love him.
Malcom Iliwara: Well, I don't know.
(On the stage, there is a rock singer with magenta clothing and shades with a yellow guitar.)

Daniel Iliwara: Rock our world, Matt!
Matt Marvelous: Oh, okay. (He plays the guitar softly)
Malcom Iliwara: Matt Marvelous? Well, I can barely hear him.
Daniel Iliwara: Just wait. (Matt plays softly but now loud like rock n roll) See? This guy rocks.
Malcom Iliwara: Well, if you say so.
Daniel Iliwara: If he didn't rock, this guy wouldn't be a finalist in the contest.
(Matt plays loud suddenly a white tornado appears above Matt while Daniel is doing rock n roll mimics)

Malcom Iliwara: Oh no, Daniel.
Daniel Iliwara: What the?
(A tornado appears big while a enormous white muscular Vampire appears roaring and the three other vampires while Matt was petrified)

Matt Marvelous: What's going on?
Malcom Iliwara: Incredible.
(The vampires form around in circles, capturing Matt and taking him up)

Matt Marvelous: Let me go!
(Daniel and his grandfather watch with horror. Daniel runs up to the stage and sees Matt Marvelous getting picked up by a gigantic vampire using its hand. They both disappear with the stage empty as a banner falls and Daniel's grandfather appears onstage as his face appears at an extreme close-up.)

Malcom Iliwara: (gravely) The vampire legend is true.
(The movie fades to black.)

"Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire"

(Later, a storm appears above the Pacific Ocean, as a cruise ship rolls above the waves. A flock of bats fly out from one of the ship's windows, and the Scooby-Doo! Where are You? theme song begins playing. The gang is now walking around the ship looking for clues as a pair of sea serpents watches them from behind while the scenes are reenactments of the song.)

Scene 2
(The next morning, the ship sails smoothly as Fred and Velma are shuffleboarding)

Velma Dinkley: (sighs) This is the life.
Fred Jones: Yeah, it sure is. And now that we've solved the mystery of the Sea Serpent Smugglers, our vacation should be smooth sailing.
(Later at the pool, Daphne is on top of the diving board and does a flip and splashes in the water, soaking Fred and Velma)

Velma Dinkley: Great formed, Daphne.
Fred Jones: Yeah, I'll say.
(Daphne laughs. Now we go to the buffet restaurant, we see Shaggy holding a giant sandwich and we see Scooby was about to eat a pizza, but sees the sandwich)

Shaggy Rogers: This should be our appetizers.
(Scooby takes bite of the pizza and throws it away as a boomerang and snag the giant sandwich away and he eats the whole thing in one gulp)

(Now we go outside of the cruise ship as Velma takes look outside)

Velma Dinkley: Hey, everybody come take a look. Sydney harbor!
Fred Jones: Wow, we're finally in Australia.
Daphne Blake: This is going to be the best vacation ever!
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh!
(Now we go to the dock as many people and the heroes walks downstairs getting off the cruise ship)

Fred Jones: And no vacation will be complete without the mystery machine!
(The crane gently lowers the mystery machine to the ground, as we go to the heroes in the mystery machine)

Velma Dinkley: This guidebook says Sydney has the best restaurants... in the entire southern hemisphere.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, that's great, Velma, but Scoob and I have got the food situation covered.
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh. Doggie bags.
Shaggy Rogers: That's right, Scoob. Doggie bags.
Velma Dinkley: Better eat now, guys. We've got sightseeing to do... and pictures to take. Say "Vegemite.""
Shaggy and Scooby: Vegemite.
(Velma takes a picture and we cut to the gang on the bridge)

Velma Dinkley: What an incredible view.
Shaggy Rogers: You can see the whole continent up here.
Velma Dinkley: The Sydney Harbour Bridge is the world's largest free-standing bridge.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, that's a long way down, huh, Scoob?
(Scooby gets scared and hangs on to the pole)

Shaggy Rogers: What's with the groovy ceiling on that place?
Velma Dinkley: That's the Sydney Opera House. It's the city's most famous landmark.
Shaggy Rogers: It looks like an old-fashioned sailing ship.
Velma Dinkley: That's the idea, Shaggy.
Daphne Blake: Oh, wow!
Fred Jones: What is it, Daphne?
Daphne Blake: I finally found what I've been looking for. Bondi Beach.
(Now we go to the beach)

Fred Jones: Lunch is served.
Velma Dinkley: Be right here, Freddie.
Fred Jones: Come on gang, everything's going to get cold.
(Shaggy and Scooby are now on a surfboard)

Shaggy Rogers: Let's catch this wave, I'm hungry.
(Suddenly a shark is sneaking behind them, later as Daphne puts on sunblock, two lifeguards watch her.)

Beach Bondi Lifeguard #1: What a sheila!
Beach Bondi Lifeguard #2: I‘ll say, mate.
(They look at each other and walk toward Daphne, while Fred stands there, jealously, and turns a bright shade of red, until he exhales. Shaggy and Scooby go surfing on the waves.)

Scooby-Doo: Scooby Dooby-Doo!
(A shark is behind them and attacks Shaggy and Scooby. The shark bites on their surfboard, as Scooby and Shaggy run for their lives. The shark chases them on the beach, devours the grill Fred was cooking the food, and scares the lifeguards away. Shaggy and Scooby then wash up on the shore, as a crab grabs Scooby's tail with its claw, causing poor Scooby to then run around Shaggy in a circle. Shaggy grabs the crab and pulls it off of Scooby's tail.)

Shaggy Rogers: Come on, Scoob. It's just a little guy, no need to get all crabby. (Shaggy puts the crab down on the sand, but it grabs his toe with his claw) Ouch!
Velma Dinkley: Come here you guys, I've got a great idea.
(They go to the others)

Velma Dinkley: How do you guys feel about exploring the outback?
Shaggy and Scooby: Outback?
Fred Jones: Sure, Australia's not all beach. The outback's the wild, inland part.
Velma Dinkley: My guidebook says it makes up almost 85 percent of the continent.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, I know what the outback is... and I don't want to go ""out back"" to look at dust and trees.
Daphne Blake: Come on, guys, I'm sure there's more to see than that.
Velma Dinkley: And I've got 17 rolls of film to capture it all.
Fred Jones: What if you could hear great music while you were there?
Shaggy Rogers: In the middle of nowhere?
Fred Jones: Not ""nowhere."" There, look.
(They see a poster for a rock festival)

Daphne Blake: A vampire rock music festival!
Shaggy & Scooby: Vampire!?
Daphne Blake: That sounds like a lot of fun, Freddie!
Velma Dinkley: Vampire Rock is located right in the middle of Australia. We can see a lot of the outback on our way there.
Shaggy Rogers: Scoob and I don't think it's a good idea going to a place where vampires rock. That's asking for trouble.
Scooby-Doo: Reah, rouble.
Fred Jones: That's just the name of the place.
Velma Dinkley: And there's no such thing as vampires.
Daphne Blake: And I'm sure a festival that big will have every concession stand imaginable.
Shaggy Rogers: Licorice pizza, chocolate-covered corn on the cob, tutti-frutti ice cream (laughs) not to mention some great local food.
(They changed into Austrailian clothings)

Scooby-Doo: Ready.
Fred Jones: Real music lovers.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, who ever heard of Australian vampires, anyway?
(Later, at Vampire Rock, we see a guy with blonde hair and a middle-aged obese man on stage)

Russell: The rules of the contest are very simple. It's for unsigned bands, no one can enter more than once. And as I've told you again and again, each contestant only gets three minutes.
Jasper Ridgeway: But the Bad Omens' best song lasts five.
Russell: Daniel and I have set the rules, and rules are rules, Jasper.
Jasper Ridgeway: Can't you bend the rules a little? Especially for such an upstanding group of young people?
(We see the Bad Omens on the stage)

King: This better be important. I've got things to pierce.
Jack: I'm trying to find a new shade of eyeliner.
(He puts eyeliner under his right eyebrow while Queen blows a bubble which pops)

Russell: You were saying?
Jasper Ridgeway: Come on, Russell, now that Matt Marvelous is gone... it's obvious the Bad Omens are the best in the contest. Why not just declare us the winner now?
King: Yeah, obviously.
Russell: Jasper, get out of my face or the Bad Omens won't perform at all.
Jasper Ridgeway: You're making a big mistake, Russell. I didn't have to come back here. Especially after what happened to Wildwind last year. But I am back. And I intend to have my group win this time.
Russell: I'm warning you.
Jasper Ridgeway: (scoffs) Let's get out of here.
(They get on the golf cart and they drove away)

Russell: How much of that did you hear, partner?
Daniel Illiwara: Enough. Jasper's never going to get over what happened to Wildwind.
(They look at the poster)

Daniel Illiwara: I can't believe it's been almost a year since they disappeared.
Russell: From what you said about last night, it sounds like they're making a comeback. Maybe it's true what they say.
Daniel Illiwara: About Wildwind being turned into vampires? Come on, that's just a local myth.
Russell: What do you think happened to Matt Marvelous then? You saw the vampires with your own two eyes.
Daniel Illiwara: I don't know what I saw, Russell.
Russell: Well, the crew looked all over Vampire Rock. There's no sign of Matt or your vampires.
Daniel Illiwara: Maybe my grandfather was right. Maybe we should postpone the festival.
Russell: No way. We've both worked too hard to quit now, Daniel.
Daniel Illiwara: You're right. And the show must go on. (He puts his hand on Russell's shoulder and up at Vampire Rock) This kidnapping makes me nervous, Russell. Very nervous
(Later, the Mystery Machine is now on the road in the outback and in the back Shaggy and Scooby and the guys playing a video game)

Shaggy Rogers: There's the Scooby Snax. (The video game counterparts grab the box and in the back Scooby and Shaggy high fived)
Velma Dinkley: Aren't you guys ever gonna stop playing that game?
Shaggy Rogers: Like, I said before nothing to look at, but dust and trees. (The Mystery Machine droves on the road)
Velma Dinkley: You'd be surprised Shaggy. The outback is full of life.
Shaggy Rogers: Oh boy, like I'll believe when I see it.
(Later, the gang are the outback and background music playing "Gonna go to the rock show" having a picnic)

(The Mystery Machine continues the way to Vampire Rock)

Fred Jones: Just a few more miles, I mean kilometers. Anyway, we're almost there.
Scene 3
(Later, the gang are now traveling to a mountain with three holes)

Daphne Blake: It's amazing that they're having a music festival way out here.
(As they are driving everyone gasp)

Velma Dinkley: There it is, Vampire Rock.
Fred Jones: Wow!
Daphne Blake: It's spectular!
Shaggy Roger: Man, we really are in the middle of nowhere.
Velma Dinkley: It says the locals call it Vampire Rock because they believe the Yowie Yahoo lives in the rock caves.
Daphne Blake: The Yowie Yahoo?
Velma Dinkley: An ancient Australian vampire.
Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! We were wrong, Scoob.There are Australian vampires. 
(Then, Velma printed a picture of the Yowie Yahoo)

Shaggy Rogers: Next time I agree to go to a place named after a vampire...I need you to do me a favor, Scoob.
Scooby-Doo: What?
Shaggy Rogers: Like, talk me out of it.
(They continue until they stopped)

Daphne Blake: Are we in the right place, Freddie?
Fred Jones: Uh-huh. This is it.
(Shagy and Scooby peek out and look around)

(And the gang walk to find the festival is, until Scooby hears a scary noise and the red eyes show up, and gets Shaggy's attention.)

Shaggy Rogers: What is it, Scoob?
(Scooby tries to tell them about the red eyes, but they don't see them)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, very funny, Scoob. You almost had us going there.
(Then Scooby looks again and the red eyes appeared again, and then out of the trees came out the Yowie Yahoo, and Scooby gets scared and jump on Shaggy)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, what is it now?
(Then the Yowie Yahoo appears again, and scares the three)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! It's the Yowie Yahoo!
Fred Jones: Where?
(They look around to see it, but couldn't find anything)

Daphne Blake: Come on, you two. We don't have time for games.
Shaggy Rogers: It's no game. Scoob, Serena, and I saw the Yowie Yahoo right over there.
(Scooby nods)

Velma Dinkley: I already told you guys, there's no such thing as a vampire.
Shaggy Rogers: Then what's making all that noise?
Fred Jones: Whatever it is, it's moving closer.
(the noise gets louder and louder)

Daphne Blake: Well, do something, Freddie.
(He shines a light at the bushes and spotted to the red eyes)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! It's the vampire!
(Then they, here dingo dogs howl at the vampire, The dingos kept on howling and growl at the red eyes until they're gone, and the coyotes left) (Daphne hears music)

Daphne Blake: Hey, do you guys hear that?
Fred Jones: Come on, gang. There must be somebody else around here.
(They follow Fred while Velma takes a picture and then to the stage)

Fred Jones: This way.
(It was the Hex Girls playing "I'm a Hex Girl" while the gang is there listening)

Daphne Blake: Hey, it's the Hex Girls! (Daphne grooves)
Shaggy Rogers: I knew those tunes sound so familiar.
(The Hex Girls stopped playing as the sound goes off and sees the gang and ran)

Thorn: It is you! (Thorn shakes Fred's hand)
Fred Jones: Boy, are we glad to see you.
Dusk: What are you doing here?
Daphne Blake: Well, we were on vacation.
Fred Jones: And we thought we'd check out the Festival.
Luna: Cool, we’re opening the festival.
Velma Dinkley: How long have you girls been here?
Luna: A couple of days. Why?
Velma Dinkley: Have you seen anything strange since you arrived?
Dusk: Strange?
Thorn: Like what?
Shaggy Rogers: Like what?
(Scooby does monster impersonations)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, how about big, creepy, and, like scary!
Daniel Illiwara: I was wondering why the music stopped.
Russell: We came to make sure you're alright.
Luna: Of course we're all right.
Dusk: Why wouldn't we be?
Russell: Just checking. Aren't you going to introduce us to your friends?
Thorn: Yeah. Daniel and Russell, these are our friends from America, Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy...
Scooby-Doo: And Scooby-Doo.
Russell: Welcome.
Daniel Illiwara: Sorry to interrupt. We're trying to clear up some trouble before the festival starts.
Luna: What's going on?
Russell: The finalists from our unsigned band contest are disappearing.
Daphne Blake: Well, that's not good. (Shaggy and Scooby hide behind the girls)
Shaggy Rogers: Like did you say... (laughs nervously) "disappeared"?
Daniel Iliwara: The groups are bailing as quickly as they arrived. They hear that Matt Marvelous has been kidnapped and go from "g'day" to "goodbye".
Fred Jones: Kidnapped? By who?
Shaggy Rogers: Like by maybe big, creepy, and like scary.
Old Man: Vampire. Daniel, I warned you terrible things would happen. (He starts his car and drove off)
Shaggy Rogers: Like who was that spooky old man?
Daniel Iliwara: That was my grandfather, Malcolm Iliwara.
Shaggy Rogers: Oh, I meant spooky in a good way.
(Daniel glares and Scooby hops on Shaggy's shoulder as Scooby laughs)

Daniel Iliwara: You'll have to forgive him, he's very upset.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, I understand. I'm pretty upset myself right now.
Velma Dinkley: What did your grandfather mean by "terrible things"?
Daniel Iliwara: The Yowie Yahoo.
Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! Like, you mean the vampire who lives in there? (Shaggy points at Vampire rock)
Daniel Illiwara: Yeah he and his vampire minions.
Fred Jones: Minions? You mean he has help?
Daniel Illiwara: Well, so they say. But there's no such thing as vampires.
Russell: Don't you mean rock star vampires? That's Wildwind.
Luna: I've seen groups like Wildwind in my parents' record collection.
Thorn: Yeah. Check out the makeup and costumes. This poster must be from a long time ago.
Russell: Nope. The members of Wildwind are only a couple of years older than you. Wildwind wanted to bring glam rock back. They did an amazing songat last year's unsigned-band contest. Dark Skull played guitar, Stormy Weathers played bass, and Lightning Strikes was on drums.
Daphne Blake: Wow! So you saw them perform?
Russell: I sure did. They deserved better than third place.
Velma Dinkley: What happened to them?
Russell: After they lost the contest, they went up to Vampire Rock to camp. They were never heard from again.
Fred Jones: They just disappeared?
Daniel Illiwara: The locals believed the Yowie Yahoo turn them into vampires.
Shaggy Rogers: I'm with the locals, that explain the big, creepy, like scary......
Daphne Blake: All right, Shaggy. We get your point.
Velma Dinkley: There's no such thing as vampires, you said it yourself, Daniel.
Russell: Well, maybe not. But Daniel says he saw Matt Marvelous get kidnapped by three vampires who looked like Wildwind.
Daniel Illiwara: I never actually said, ""vampires.""
Russell: Do you have a better explanation?
Daniel Illiwara: Whoever or whatever they were, they were pretty convincing. Now I don't know what to think.
Velma Dinkley: When did this all start, Daniel?
Daniel Illiwara: Ever since I was a boy, my grandfather told me the Yowie Yahoo Iived in Vampire Rock. I never believed him. But in the past few months there have been a lot of strange lights and sounds coming from up there. I'd love to find out what's really going on.
Fred Jones: Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.
(Shaggy and Scooby tip-toed backwards, after they heard Fred)

Russell: A mystery?
Velma Dinkley: We'll need to investigate this from the inside.
Fred Jones: And the best way to do that is to go undercover as a rock band. If we're lucky, the Wildwind vampires will try to kidnap us next.
Shaggy Rogers: I don't want to be that lucky.
Daphne Blake:That's a great idea, Freddie.
Russell: I'm not so sure about this.
Daniel Illiwara: They may be our only hope.
Russell: I guess it could work. Especially if it keeps my pick to win the contest from getting kidnapped.
Daniel Illiwara: And who's that?
Russell: Two Skinny Dudes. They haven't shown up yet. I know you've never seen them perform, but trust me, they're the real deal.
Fred Jones: So what do you say?
Russell: Well, okay. But don't say I didn't warn you.
Shaggy Rogers: Scoob and I wouldn't mind sitting this one out.
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh.
Shaggy Rogers: Maybe the group should be a trio.
(They try to chicken out, but the Hex Girls push them back)

Thorn: Come on, you chickens. Luna, Dusk and I will help you look the part.
Luna: Yeah, there's a wardrobe room backstage.
Dusk: This is going to be fun.
Shaggy Rogers: I knew coming to a place called Vampire Rock was a bad idea.
(We go to the eyes that were watching them and the scene fades)

Scene 4
(On top of the mountain, the three dingoes from last night stand on a mountain perch and howl at the moon. At the foot of the mountain, the gang is rehearsing for the rock concert while wearing their new costumes. Velma has trouble standing around in her platform boots.)

Velma Dinkley: How do rockstars walk in these?
Daphne Blake: Pretend they're high heels.
Velma Dinkley: I'm not good at those either.
(Shaggy plays a guitar, but one of the strings breaks. Scooby plays the drum, but a cymbal flies off and hits on Scooby's head.)

Fred Jones: I don't know how well we'll play, but at least we look the part.
Velma Dinkley: I hope we don't have to play at all.
Daphne Blake: I thought you loved to sing, Velma.
Velma Dinkley: Not in front of so many people. I get stage fright.
Shaggy Rogers: Well, I get vampire fright. (Scooby bangs the drums as a comedy routine.)
Daphne Blake: Hey, look at this.
Velma Dinkley: Makeup?
Daphne Blake: Stage makeup, actually. So the audience can see you better.
Shaggy Rogers: Matt Marvelous was a musician.
Daphne Blake: Even so, I doubt he'd wear this color. It's glowing white.
Fred Jones: And look at this, it's a footprint. From a hiking boot to be exact. Wow, that's strange.
Daphne Blake: How so?
Fred Jones: The print is sticky like glue. But it's not glue exactly. I don't know what it is.
(Then, Jasper drives up in his golf cart and drops off the Bad Omens.)

Jasper Ridgeway: Are you our competition?
Fred Jones: Yeah, we're fillin' Matt Marvelous's place in the contest. 
(The Bad Omens laugh.) 

Daphne Blake: You must be Jasper Ridgeway. 
Velma Dinkley: You must be the Bad Omens. 
Daphne Blake: Russell warn.... I mean, told us about you. 
King: And whoever heard of a band with a dog in it? 
(Scooby looks confused and looks around. He scowls and plays the drums rapidly, but they fall as he smiles sheepishly.)

Queen: Why don't you amateurs take a break?
Jack: Yeah. It's time for a real band to play.
Fred Jones: Come on, guys. Let's set up camp for the night anyway.
Jasper Ridgeway: Camping? How primitive. I choose to travel in a fully furnished, air-conditioned trailer.
Velma Dinkley: Russell told us about another band you used to manage, Wildwind.
Jasper Ridgeway: Yes, they were true superstars. I had such high hopes for them. Until that fateful night last year. I don't like to talk about it. It's just too upsetting. Well, back to the trailer. I can't take this heat any longer. Enjoy your rehearsal. (He drives away, but his golf cart starts malfunctioning.) Stupid golf cart!
(Jasper finally gets his golf car up and running and then drives away, leaving the gang literally the dust.)

Fred Jones: (coughs) Nice to meet you too!
Velma Dinkley: Let's get out of these costumes and start looking for clues.
(Velma tries to walk off, but she loses her balance and falls down. Fortunately, Daphne grabs her for support.)

Daphne Blake: And get you into more comfortable shoes.
Scene 5
(We fade to them walking from the stage)

Fred Jones: I think we may have met our so-called vampires.
Velma Dinkley: The Bad Omens?
Fred Jones: Exactly. Jasper Ridgeway seems the kind of guy who'd do anything to have his band win.
Velma Dinkley: You think he put them up to it?
Fred Jones: Um-hum.
(They continue to walk whey they get to the food stands, and Shaggy and Scooby got excited.)

Daphne Blake: The makeup the Bad Omens were wearing looks like the stage makeup I found.
Velma Dinkley: Maybe we should talk to Daniel and Russell and find out more about them.
Daphne Blake: I bet Jasper's trailer could tell us a thing or two.
Fred Jones: Yeah, let's check it out. Shaggy and Scooby, you and the others see what you can dig up around here.
(Upon hearing that, they got excited)

Shaggy Rogers: We'll leave no snow cone, I mean, stone unturned.
(Later at Jasper's trailer where we see Fred, Velma, and Daphne there)

Daphne Blake: Jasper said he wasn't kidding when he said he was traveling in style.
Fred Jones: We got to get a look inside.
Daphne Blake: How are we gonna do that?
Fred Jones: We need to lure him out. And I got a plan.
Velma Dinkley: Fred.
Fred Jones: Wait. This is brilliant. I'm gonna go off into those bushes and imitate of the wild Cuckoo bird.
Velma Dinkley: But Fred.
Fred Jones: Hold on, Velma. I'm on a roll. Now, Daphne, I want you disguise yourself as an Aboriginal medicine woman and...
Velma Dinkley: Fred!
Fred Jones: What?
Velma Dinkley: Or we could just use the front door.
Fred Jones: Or that.
(They enter Jasper’s trailer)

Fred Jones: All clear.
Velma Dinkley: This is better than a museum.
Daphne Blake: Whoa. Totally retro.
Fred Jones: You're telling me.
Daphne Blake: Look, it's a waterbed.
Fred Jones: Seems like Jasper can't let go of the past.
(Velma takes a look at a picture of Jasper with Wildwind)

Velma Dinkley: In more ways than one.
Fred Jones: (looks out the window) Come on, guys, we've got to work fast. Jasper could show up at any minute.
Daphne Blake: There's so much stuff in here, it's going to be hard to tell the clues from the collectibles.
Velma Dinkley: Jinkies!
Velma Dinkley: I think I already found one.
Fred Jones: Great work, Velma.
Velma Dinkley: This looks exactly like the costume Dark Skull of Wildwind wore in that poster.
Fred Jones: The costumes for Lightning Strikes and Stormy Weathers are in here, too.
Velma Dinkley: So, Jasper Ridgeway has reproductions of all the Wildwind costumes. Interesting.
(Then Velma gets her camera and takes a picture of Daphne holding the Darkskull costume. The camera then cuts to Shaggy and Scooby eating.)

Shaggy Rogers: They call this Australian bread ""damper."" But, it's sure not putting a damper on my appetite.
(They eat the food, while Shaggy drinks two bottles of soda and throws them away. The fog appears, as the vampires appear behind Shaggy.)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, what's next, old buddy?
(Scooby screams in terror)

Scooby-Doo: Vampires!
Shaggy Rogers: What?
(He sees the vampires)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! Like, now I'm not hungry at all!
(The chase scene music is played "Get Away, Yeah!" and they ran as fast they could)​​​

Scene 6
(Later, the Bad Omens are now rehearsing while Jack drums but stops and hears screaming from Scooby and Shaggy who are still running)

Jack: What the?
(Shaggy and Scooby are still running, until they fall onto Jack’s drums and roll off the stage. The Yowie Yahoo then shows up.)

Queen: What is that?!
(The three vampire heads fly past Jack, and then a beam of light grabs the Bad Omens. They then disappear, as Fred, Daphne, and Velma arrive.)

Fred Jones: Gosh, what happened here?
Daphne Blake: (coughs) What's with all this smoke?
Fred Jones: It burns my eyes.
Velma Dinkley: (sniffs) It smells so sweet, like cotton candy.
(Shaggy and Scooby pop up from the drums.)

Shaggy Rogers: Cotton candy?
Fred Jones: Shaggy and Scooby?
Velma Dinkley: What happened to the Bad Omens?
Shaggy Rogers: Like, the Yowie Yahoo, and the Wildwind vampires showed up and band-napped them. Scoob and I thought we were next.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah!
Fred Jones: Um? Well, there goes our prime suspects.
Velma Dinkley: You actually saw the Wildwind vampires, Shaggy?
Shaggy Rogers: We both did.
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh.
Fred Jones: What did they look like?
Shaggy Rogers: Exactly like the guys on that poster, only scarier. And they had those creepy red eyes.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, red.
Fred Jones: Well, whoever it was, they kidnapped the Bad Omens.
(Then, Jasper shows up in a golf cart)

Jasper Ridgeway: Kidnapped? Not again. The Bad Omens can't be kidnapped. They need to win the contest.
Shaggy Rogers: It's a good thing you weren't here, Jasper. Those vampires would have flown off with you, too.
Jasper Ridgeway: I wish they had. Now I'll be plagued by guilt. I should have stayed with them instead of going back to my trailer.
Fred Jones: Trailer? Uhm?
(Then, Daniel arrives.)

Daniel Iliwara: What happened here?
Jasper Ridgeway: My band is gone! What are we going to do?
Fred Jones: There's strength in numbers. Let's get the Hex Girls and Russell, and then camp in one group.
Daniel Iliwara: Russell already went home, along with all the other festival staff.
Shaggy Rogers: I wish I could say the same thing.
Jasper Ridgeway: And if the vampires come back when we're sleeping, what then?
Velma Dinkley: We can take turns standing watch.
Fred Jones: And you guys have the first tour of duty
(Shaggy and Scooby are scared and tries to flee, but Fred stops them)

Fred Jones: Which starts now.
Velma Dinkley: Would you each do it for a Scooby Snack?
Daphne Blake: Or maybe two Scooby Snacks?
Shaggy Rogers: There might be room in my tummy for a Scooby Snack or two. How about you, Scoob?
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, Scooby Snack!
(They each ate the two Scooby Snacks)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, everyone get some rest, because you're being watched over by the best.
(They walk away)

Scene 7
(Later that night, Shaggy and Scooby were asleep then they hear a noise, and they see two lights)

Shaggy Rogers: Not again!
(They run off)

Shaggy Rogers: It's the vampires!
(Daniel gets a peek out of his tent to see what they're running from)

Shaggy Rogers: Run!
(They climb up the tree, and then the 2 lights were actually from motorcycles)

Shaggy Rogers: The vampires are in a motorcycle gang?
(It was two motorcycles that stoped and it was two skinny people who took off their helmets as Shaggy and Scooby appear from Fred's shoulder)

Shaggy Rogers: You’re not vampires. Like who are you?
Barry: Two skinny dudes.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, me too.
Barry: We're the band Two Skinny Dudes. I'm Barry and this is my brother, Harry.
Daniel Iliwara: Finally! I've heard so much about you from Russell. Glad you made it here all right.
Harry: Why wouldn't we?
Daniel Iliwara: Some of the other bands have been kidnapped. (Shaggy appears behind Daniel)
Shaggy Rogers: By vampires!
(Harry and Barry were confused and laughed)

Fred Jones: If you weren't kidnapped, where have you been?
Barry: Exploring Vampire Rock, we like it so much, we decided to camp out there.
Harry: But we didn't see a single vampire.
Daphne Blake: Matt Marvelous and the Bad Omens sure did.
Daniel Illiwara: And the other finalists were so scared, they went back to Sydney.
(Harry and Barry looked at each other)

Barry: Does this mean were the only ones left?
Harry: Does this mean we win the contest?
Daniel Iliwara: Not quite. We had a last minute entry.
(Shaggy and Scooby act natural, looked at them and start playing the harmonica and banjo horribly with the Gang acting natural, and Harry and Barry confused, then one of the banjo strings break and they stop playing)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, (laughs) what do you think?
Harry: Keep working on that.
(Scooby giggles then Jasper comes out of his trailer in his robe)

Jasper Ridgeway: What's all the racket? Did you find my band?
Daniel Iliwara: No, but we found another one. Jasper, meet Two Skinny Dudes.
Jasper Ridgeway: Two Skinny Dudes. Russell tells me you're the next big thing. You boys have a manager?
Harry: No.
Jasper Ridgeway: Groovy. Why don't you come into my trailer and let me tell you what I can do for your careers.
Daphne Blake: Jeepers. He works fast.
Velma Dinkley: Jasper seemed to forget about the Bad Omens pretty quickly.
(Then the sun rises)

Daniel Iliwara: We should get going. We've still got two missing bands out there and the concert starts tonight at 6:00.
Thorn: What's with all the noise?
Dusk: How are we supposed to rest for the show tonight?
Luna: In other words, would you mind?
(They go back into their tent and zips it closed)

Shaggy Rogers:​​​​​ Ha! Divas.
(Scooby rolls his eyes then later the Mystery Machine is in the outback)

Velma Dinkley: I pulled up more research on vampires.
Shaggy Rogers:​​​​​ Anything on how to avoid them?
Daniel Iliwara: You can ask my grandfather. He knows all about the local legends. Especially the Yowie Yahoo.
Velma Dinkley: Let's see. "Vampires hate sunlight. They can't cross running water." And get this: ""The more people a vampire puts under his control, the greater his power becomes.""
Daphne Blake: That would explain why the Yowie Yahoo is having Wildwind kidnap people. 
(Fred looks at Daphne)

Daphne Blake: That is, if you believe he's real.
Velma Dinkley: It also says, ""Vampires don't appear on film when their pictures are taken.""
Shaggy Rogers: Maybe they're just camera shy.
Daniel Iliwara: Here we are, Fred. Up there. Ahead on the left.
(He make a left to a house, where his grandfather is burning wood, and the heroes come to him)

Daniel Iliwara: Grandfather, these are some friends of mine. Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby.
Malcolm Iliwara: Yes, I saw you at the festival.
Daniel Iliwara: They're here to help with our problem.
Shaggy Rogers: What's the deal with the smoke signals?
Malcolm Iliwara: There's a tribal council meeting later today. I'm letting the others know. 
Daniel Iliwara: You could just use the phone, Grandfather.
Malcolm Iliwara: We've always used smoke signals to announce tribal council meetings.
Fred Jones: The smoke smells really good. What are you burning?
Malcolm Iliwara: The wood is from the red gum tree. We use its flowers to make honey. That red gum over there is in full bloom.
(Scooby goes to the tree and smells the red flower, a Koala smack his head with a stick and Scooby gets stuck on honey, he struggles to get out and then he did and crashes into the water. Later we go to the heroes are on the canoe)

Malcolm Iliwara: It is good of all of you to take me to the council meeting.
Velma Dinkley: Daniel was telling us that you know all about the Yowie Yahoo legend, Mr. Illiwara.
Malcolm Iliwara: Please, call me Malcolm. I can tell you many things about the Yowie Yahoo, young lady. But, you may not like what you hear.
Fred Jones: Can you tell us what happened to Wildwind?
Malcolm Iliwara: Wildwind foolishly went up to Vampire Rock after dark. They were easy prey for the Yowie Yahoo. Just like all the people attending the festival will be.
Shaggy Rogers: So like, what can we do to keep him and his rock-star pals away?
Malcolm Iliwara: According to legend, the only thing that can destroy a vampire is sunlight.
Daniel Iliwara: According to legends, Grandfather.
Malcolm Iliwara: It's believed they also fear the dingo.
Shaggy Rogers: They could be your distant cousins, Scoob. Like see they can help us out.
Scooby-Doo: Ruh-uh. Nuh-uh.
(Then he sees a crocodile and tries to get Shaggy's attention.)

Shaggy Rogers: Don't bother me, Scoob!
(He turns to see the crocodile disappeared. The crocodile resurface and bit Scooby on the tail. He gets launched into the air and the crocodile swallow him whole and dives back down underwater. Scooby struggles and manage to get himself out of the crocodile's mouth and lands on top of Daniel's head)

Daphne Blake: Looks like vampires aren't the only monsters around here.
Shaggy Rogers: That crocodile almost had his very own Scooby Snack.
Daniel Illiwara: Thank goodness, he didn't. I scheduled your group to perform tonight.
Velma Dinkley: "Perform?"
Daniel Illiwara: Right after the Hex Girls.
Daphne Blake: We hope you'll come, Malcolm.
Malcom Illiwara: I can't. Not when I believe the festival shouldn't take place at all.
Daniel Illiwara: I know how you feel, Grandfather. But I've got a show to do.
Scooby-Doo: Smoke! Smoke! Smoke!
Malcom Illiwara: They're answering one of my smoke signals. It's my friend on the other side of Vampire Rock. We're almost there.
Shaggy Rogers: Can you show me how to do that? If the vampires come back, I want to send an S.O.S. ""Save our Shaggy.""
(They swim towards the smoke as the camera goes to the sky)

Scene 8
(Later, at the festival we see The Hex Girls playing "Who Do Voodoo" while the gang are watching backstage)

(Later, a tornado came down as the Yowie Yahoo and the three vampires are now flying with everyone screaming and scared)

Velma Dinkley: Jinkies!
Daphne Blake: There really is a Yowie Yahoo! (Velma takes a picture)
Shaggy Rogers: That's what I've been trying to tell you!
(On the stage, the Hex Girls continue playing when the three vampires came around Thorn, Dusk, and Luna and making them feel scared, Luna tried to run away, but stopped by on of the vampires)

Daniel Iliwara: No! Not now!
(Then a vampire goes to Thorn)

Thorn: Hey, you're ruining our encore! (She hits the vampire with her guitar)
(The vampires capture the Hex Girls up and they dissappear)

Daphne Blake: Now what?
Velma Dinkley: They must be heading to Vampire Rock.
Fred Jones: We need to go after them.
Shaggy Rogers: Great idea, Fred! While you're gone, Scoob and l will practice our number.
(Scooby and Shaggy start playing the drums and guitar as one of the guitar strings broke as the crowd stops cheering)

Daniel Illiwara: Uh? Weren't the Hex Girls amazing? (The crowd complains) We'll be taking a short break. See you real soon.
(He goes to the gang)

Daniel Illiwara: What are we going to do? Maybe my grandfather was right. Where's Russell? We've got to cancel the rest of the show.
Fred Jones: Not yet. I've got a plan that will end this once and for all. Now here's what we do.
(The gang hoddle up and Fred discusses the plan)

Scene 9
(Later on top of Vampire Rock where we see the gang)

Daphne Blake: I knew Vampire Rock was big, but not this big.
Velma Dinkley: It's going to be harder finding the Hex Girls than we thought.
(Scooby & Shaggy looks down and they get scared)

Fred Jones: We need to split up. Daphne, Velma and I will head this way.  Shaggy and Scooby you circle around in that direction.
(But Shaggy and Scooby don't like the idea, and out close to Daphne and Velma)

Shaggy Rogers: Vacation has really brought us closer together. It's a shame to split up now.
(The other group search for a entrance of a cave that would lead to another clue, but couldn't find one.)

Velma Dinkley: Vampire Rock seems to be just that. Solid rock.
Fred Jones: There's got to be a way in somehow.
(Daphne then falls behind the rock that opened reveal to be a secret passageway)

Daphne Blake: You were saying?
(We go to Shaggy and Scooby, who are tired from walking around Vampire Rock)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, we'd walked all the way around this creepy rock.
(Then, they hear howling)

Shaggy Rogers: What was that? Quit kidding around, Scoob.=
(Scooby pointed what he sees, and it was the dingo dogs)

Shaggy Rogers: Dingo dogs!
(The dingo dogs starts going toward them then later the rest of the gang walking in a secret entrance)

Fred Jones: Secret passages always lead somewhere.
Velma Dinkley: Hmmm. Right now, we should be experiencing total cave darkness. But we're not, so....
Fred Jones: There must be light coming from inside the cave.
(Fred turns on his flashlight)

Daphne Blake: Over there!
(They see a light blocked by a curtain and they look inside)

Daphne Blake: Wow! I was expecting a vampire's lair to be more.... I don't know, spooky.
Fred Jones: It's like an underground warehouse.
Velma Dinkley: These lanterns didn't light themselves.
Fred Jones: Right, Velma. They're only big enough to hold a few hours worth of oil.
Daphne Blake: That means, someone had to be here a little while ago.
Velma Dinkley: They also used the equipment. This fan is still warm.
Fred Jones: And so is this light. This equipment's been used all right. The question is why?
Velma Dinkley: And where?
Daphne Blake: And by who?
(They search around and then Daphne sees a light down on the ground. Daphne investigates, but then steps on a button which opens a hidden door to another room filled with stuff as she enters.)

Daphne Blake: No coffins?
(Then the door closes leaving Daphne trapped)

Daphne Blake: Fred! Velma! (sighs)
(She walks in the tunnel and then the vampire appears and chases her)

(We cut back to Shaggy and Scooby, who are cornered by the dingoes)

Shaggy Rogers: We can't run. We can't climb. How are we going to get out of here?
(Scooby tries to dig a way out, but a ground mole kicks him out of the dirt and bring the dirt back)

Shaggy Rogers: Good try, buddy, but we need a miracle.
(The dingoes get closer as they get scared. At the same time Daphne is still being chased by the vampire, and then comes across a dead end. The vampire has her cornered, until Daphne strikes a diving pose and jumps off the cliff, performing a cannonball. As the dingoes corner Shaggy and Scooby, Daphne splashes into a pond, soaking Shaggy, Scooby, and the dingoes, who then run off.)

Shaggy Rogers: Like I said, "A miracle." Or Daphne doing a dive off a cliff. That's a 10.
Daphne Blake: Thanks, guys.
(Cut to Fred and Velma)

Velma Dinkley: What a mess.
Fred Jones: You think Daphne's in here?
Velma Dinkley: If she is, she's not alone.
Fred Jones: I'm going to check down here.
Velma Dinkley: Daphne! (Then, she trips and loses her glasses) My glasses. I lost my glasses. (One of the vampires gives the glasses back to Velma.) Thanks, Freddie. I was getting worried. (She sees the vampires surrounding her.) Now I am worried.
(She runs and then she bump into Fred)

Fred Jones: Velma! Did you find Daphne?
Velma Dinkley: Wherever Daphne is, she's a lot safer than we are.
(They see the vampires heading toward them)

Fred Jones: Run!
(They run from the vampires chasing them)

Daphne Blake: And he was hanging upside down. Then, he took off after me. Come on, we've got to find Fred and Velma.
Fred Jones: (shouting) Geeeeroooonimoooo!
Velma Dinkley: (screaming)
(They see Fred and Velma jumping off the cliff and splash into the pond, soaking Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby.)

Shaggy Rogers: Or they could find us.
Daphne Blake: Fred! Velma! Guys! You're all right.
Velma Dinkley: Not if we don't get out of here.
(The vampires fly in smoke and they create a cloud.)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! I need a vacation from this vacation.
(Then the Yowie Yahoo appears out of the smoke)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, it's the Yowie Yahoo!
Scooby-Doo: Rowie Rahoo?
(The Yowie Yahoo launches fireballs and creates explosion scaring Scooby)

Fred Jones: Come on! Everyone over the bridge!
(They try to go over the bridge but the Wildwind vampires blocked their way. And the Yowie Yahoo blows out fire at the heroes and they dodged it. And then the Yowie Yahoo throws fire balls, as Shaggy and Scooby find cover. They stick their heads and goes down, as the boulder gets busted by the fireball.)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, if there was ever a time not to be calm, this is it!
(The Yowie Yahoo flies after Fred and the girls, and he claps making a loud wave that knocked Velma down. And the Yowie Yahoo, blows a strong wind at them as Fred tries to get to Velma, but she gets blown away from him. And he throws fireballs again, as one of them made Scooby'd tail to go on fire. And Scooby runs out of his hiding spot.)

Shaggy Rogers: Scooby! Get back here!
(Scooby runs into a pond and place his tail to get rid of the fire. The Yowie Yahoo blows again, causing Fred to get blown away as his shirt blew out of Fred and straight onto Shaggy)

Shaggy Rogers: The Yowie Yahoo sure is full of hot air.
Daphne Blake: Freddie, are you okay?
Fred Jones: Now I know how my socks feel in the dryer.
(The Yowie Yahoo roars, as Velma and Scooby prace in fear)

Velma Dinkley: I feel the same way, Scooby.
(Then the dingo dogs show up again)

Shaggy Rogers: It's the dingo dogs!
(The dingo dogs go down to the Windwind vampires, snarling at them, and chase them to the mountains)

Daphne Blake: They're getting away!
Fred Jones: They've got to get inside before the sun comes out.
Shaggy Rogers: Hey Scoob, tell your cousins, "Don't leave us here with the.... Yowie Yahoo!"
(Then the Yowie Yahoo blows wind at the heroes.)

Fred Jones: Hang on tight, guys.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, Fred, do we have a choice?
(The sun is about to rise)

Velma Dinkley: The sun is almost up.
Fred Jones: The Yowie Yahoo has to get inside Vampire Rock, too.
Velma Dinkley: If he doesn't, the sun will destroy him.
(The sun appears and the sunlight reflected off of Scooby's dog tag and it hits the Yowie Yahoo and then it is been defeated as it dies in the clouds)

Daphne Blake: You did it, Scooby! You defeated the Yowie Yahoo!
Shaggy Rogers: He sure didn't go quietly.
(The dingoes howl in victory, as Scooby howls with them, and then the dingoes walk away)

Velma Dinkley: How about that, Scooby? You're an honorary dingo.
Scooby-Doo: Ringo? Hooray!
(Then, the dark figure of the vampire appears.)

Daphne Blake: But what about the Hex Girls?
Shaggy Rogers: How about we ask the vampire, where they are?
(The vampires charge toward the gang.)

Fred Jones: Quick! Over the bridge! (Fred is forced to carry the gang as they cross the bridge.) Don't worry, gang. I've got you!
Shaggy Rogers: As long as you've got us and they don't!
(The vampires continue to chase them.)

Daphne Blake: The sunlight destroyed the Yowie Yahoo. Why isn't it destroying Wildwind?
Fred Jones: You want to stop and ask them or keep on running?
Daphne Blake: No thanks.
Shaggy Rogers: We just crossed running water. The vampires shouldn't be able to follow us.
(But they are able to run across running water.)

Shaggy Rogers: Didn't those vampires read the rule book?
(As the gang continues running, Shaggy crashes into a tree and Scooby grabs him to escape. At the same time, Fred, Daphne, and Velma are preparing to set a trap on the vampires)

Fred Jones: Now!
(Daniel tosses a boomerang that triggers the trap, and the snare rope catches Shaggy and Scooby, and then the net falls on the vampires, and it brings them up.)

Fred Jones: Nice work, Daniel.
Scene 10
(Shaggy and Scooby fall, and Fred catches Scooby. Velma paces, trying to catch Shaggy, but he lands on the ground anyway, causing Velma to cringe. The fake vampires land on the ground as well.)

Shaggy Rogers: I didn't think anything would stop those vampires.
Velma Dinkley: That's because they're not real vampires. If they were, they wouldn't have been captured on film.
Jasper Ridgeway: Jolly good work. You've snared the vampires.
Daniel Iliwara: Now we can find out what happened to the bands.
Velma Dinkley: At first we thought the Bad Omens were behind all this. But when they disappeared, we had to search for new suspects.
(Fred uses the hose to spray water at the vampires and reveal to be "Two Skinny Dudes")

Daniel Iliwara: Well, I’ll be. Two Skinny dudes. So that’s two vampires, so who’s the third?
(Then, the third one revealed to be Russell)

Shaggy and Scooby: Russell!
Daniel Iliwara: Russell, you were my partner. This doesn't make any sense.
Shaggy Rogers: I'm with Daniel.
Russell: Nobody say anything.
Fred Jones: That's fine. We can do all the talking and still get to the bottom of this mystery.
Velma Dinkley: It took us a while to put all the pieces together. When we saw Jasper getting so chummy with the Two Skinny Dudes... we thought he might be the third vampire.
Jasper Ridgeway: Me? I could never wear all that makeup. I've got very sensitive skin.
Velma Dinkley: You managed the Bad Omens, Jasper. We thought you took some of their makeup... so you and the Two Skinny Dudes could copy Wildwind's glam rock look.
Fred Jones: We also paid a visit to your trailer when you said you'd be there. You were nowhere to be found.
Jasper Ridgeway: That's not a crime.
(Then, Velma glares at Japser)

Jasper Ridgeway: Okay. Confession time. I wasn't in my trailer... because I was meeting with the Hex Girls about being their manager. I didn't want the Bad Omens to find out what I was doing.
Daphne Blake: But that doesn't explain why you have costumes like the ones Wildwind wore.
Jasper Ridgeway: Wildwind was the greatest band I ever managed. I had those costumes made to remind me of all the good times we had together. I wish I knew what happened to them.
Fred Jones: Why don't you ask them yourself?
(They unmasked Russell and Two Skinny Dudes revealing three strangers in disquise)

Jasper Ridgeway: What the-?
Shaggy Rogers: Okay, like now I'm really confused.
Scooby-Do: Me too.
(Daphne brings out make up and puts it on the three man)

Daphne Blake: Recognize them now?
(They revealed to be Wildwind)

Jasper Ridgeway: I don't believe it. Wildwind, you're alive.
Lightning Strikes: We should have won that contest last year. When we didn't, we'd decided to disappeared.
(Their flashback started)

Stormy Weathers: We thought disappearing mysteriously would help our careers.
Dark Skull: Then we remembered the contest rules... meant we couldn't enter again.
Lightning Strikes: We planned on making a triumphant return at this year's unsigned-band contest.
(Their flashback ended)

Fred Jones: Right. That's when you made a plan to get around those rules... and make sure you'd win this year's contest.
Daphne Blake: With Dark Skull already posing, as Russell, Stormy Weathers and Lightning Strikes, became the Two Skinny Dudes, an unsigned band in the contest.
Velma Dinkley: The three of them took advantage of the local legend surrounding them and disguised themselves as vampires. They planned to kidnap all the other bands in the contest. Then, Two Skinny Dudes would be declared the winner.
Fred Jones: But the crowd wouldn't see Two Skinny Dudes close out the festival. Instead, Wildwind would come on stage and perform.
Velma Dinkley: They hoped the attention from closing the show at Vampire Rock would make their careers take off.
Daniell Iliwara: I'm starting to get it.
Shaggy Rogers: But if they're not vampires, how did they fly?
(Scooby flies like a bird)

Fred Jones: Easy, Shaggy. Their mountain-climbing equipment.
(Scooby falls down, and another flashback starts with the Wildwind attaching the ropes to themselves making Darkskull fly)

Fred Jones: They rigged it to the stage so they could swoop down and kidnap the acts.
Jasper Ridgeway: This is all very interesting. But will somebody please tell me where the Bad Omens are?
Fred Jones: That's the answer we don't have.
Lightning Strikes: We sent them and Matt Marvelous on diving trips to the Great Barrier Reef.
Stormy Weathers: Four expenses paid. They were thrilled.
(Shaggy and Scooby ran off and back this time with diving suits)

Shaggy Rogers: You should have just asked us. I've been wanting to leave since I got here.
Dark Skull: We didn't really kidnap anybody.
Velma Dinkley: What about the Hex Girls? They weren't your competition.
Stormy Weathers: But you were.
Darkskull: We knew you would come after them... giving us the chance to send you on your way as well.
Fred Jones: Where are the Hex Girls now?
Thorn: Don't worry. We're fine.
(We see the Hex Girls save and sound with Malcom)

Daphne Blake: Thorn, Dusk, Luna! You're all right.
Luna: Those creepy guys took us back to their hideout in Vampire Rock.
Dusk: They offered us a free trip if we would leave the festival, but we refused.
Thorn: So they took us into the outback and left us there.
Fred Jones: They knew we'd keep looking until we found you... making us miss our chance to perform.
Daphne Blake: And leave Two Skinny Dudes as the only group left in the contest.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, how did you find your way back here?
Thorn: We wandered around the outback for hours, until Malcolm found us.
Malcom Illiwara: The way they were dressed, I first thought they were vampires, too.
Daniel Illiwara: There are no vampires, Grandfather.
Fred Jones: Daniel's right, Mr. Illiwara. Wildwind is definitely human.
Velma Dinkley: They used smoke whenever they flew, so no one could see their climbing ropes. You helped us figure that part out, sir.
Daphne Blake: They burned wood from the red gum tree, making sweet smoke like your signals.
Shaggy Rogers: And like, that's why we also found a boot print made from red gum on stage.
Malcom Illiwara: What about the Yowie Yahoo?
Fred Jones: We got an explanation for that too.
Daniel Iliwara: I'm sure you do.
Velma Dinkley: Wildwind spent a lot of time perfecting their act. They're masters of special effects.
Fred Jones: They used pictures of the Yowie Yahoo to help pull off their hoax. They placed the pictures on holographic disks.
Velma Dinkley: When light was shined through the disks... three-dimensional images of the Yowie Yahoo were created. These images could be beamed anywhere to help Wildwind with their plan.
Fred Jones: To make the Yowie Yahoo even more realistic they added fire, wind and explosions.
Shaggy Rogers: So because he was just a projection, the sunlight reflecting off Scooby's tag made the Yowie Yahoo disappear.
Fred Jones: Bingo, Shaggy.
Velma Dinkley: Thanks to Scooby, we were able to solve the mystery.
Malcolm Illiwara: I'm sorry, Daniel... for letting my belief in the vampire legend get in the way of your show.
Daniel Illiwara: Wildwind had us all fooled, Grandfather.
Dark Skull: And we would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.
Daniel Illiwara: Since all the other bands are eliminated, that makes you guys the winner.
Velma Dinkley: Does this mean what I think it means?
(Later, at the festival with a large crowd, Daniel is on the microphone at the festival with the curtain closed)

Daniel Iliwara: And now I would like to introduce the final act of this year's Vampire Rock Music Festival. But first, did everyone have a good time?! (The crowd cheered) I said, DID EVERYONE HAVE A GOOD TIME?!
(Behind the curtain, we see Mystery Inc ready to rock with Velma nervous)

Velma Dinkley: I'm not having a good time.
Shaggy Rogers: Come on, Velma. This is gonna be fun.
Velma Dinkley: But there's so many people. Besides, we don't even have a name for our group.
Scooby-Doo: Name?
Daniel Iliwara: And now, please help me welcome the "Meddling Kids"! (The curtain opens)
Daphne Blake: "Meddling Kids"?
Fred Jones: Works for me!
(Velma watches confusingly but confidently goes to the microphone and sings "Scooby-Doo! Where are you?".)

[Velma]
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
We got some work to do now.
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
(Daniel is snapping his fingers as Malcolm puts his hand on Daniel's shoulder then Scooby plays the drums well and Shaggy's guitar strings break)

We need some help from you now.
Come on, Scooby-Doo,
I see you,
pretending you got a sliver.
You're not fooling me,
'cause I can see,
the way you shake and shiver.
You know we got a mystery to solve,
so Scooby-Doo, be ready for your act.
Don't hold back!
(Then The Hex Girls appear on stage)

And, Scooby-Doo, if you come through,
you're going to have yourself a Scooby Snack!
That's a fact!
(Scooby plays drums as Shaggy jumps off the stage to be caught but instead he gets hurt)

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, here are you.
You're ready and you're willing.
If we can count on you, Scooby-Doo,
I know we'll catch that villain.
I know we'll catch that villain.
I know we'll catch that villain.
(The fireworks shot right into the air. The dingoes were watching and howl down to Scooby)

Scooby-Doo: (howls) Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
(The movie ends)
