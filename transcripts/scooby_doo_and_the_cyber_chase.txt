(The film starts at a beaker that is boiling)

"Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase"

(we see an elderly scientist who is examining a chemical in a test tube, who is still confused and leaves walking out of two rooms and went into a computer lab with two scientists)

Professor Kaufman: Any progress, Eric?
Eric Staufer: Sorry, Professor Kaufman. There's still something wrong with the program.
Professor Kaufman: Well, we can't do any more experiments with the lasers on, until you boys fix it.
Bill McLemore: We know, we know. Hey, wait! I found something!
(The computer flashes, then the laser is been activated)

Professor Kaufman: Who turned on the laser?!
Bill and Eric: Not me!
Professor Kaufman: Shut it down!
Bill McLemore: I can't! It's not responding!
(Then the laser beamed a strange blue figure, they gasped, and the blue figure laughs, as it heads towards them)

Professor Kaufman: What is that?
Eric Staufer: I was hoping you know, Professor.
(Phantom Virus begins to absorb the computer data)

Bil McLemore: Look! He's absorbing all of computer data.
Professor Kaufman: Call security!
(The virus made a phone come to life and then the wires grab Eric's arm. Kaufman and Bill tries to help him free then they see the virus walking closer to them, doing an evil laugh)

(Later in the morning, we see the Mystery Machine on the nice road)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, are we there yet, Fred?
Fred Jones: I told you, Shaggy, soon.
Shaggy Rogers: But you said that an hour ago, man.
Daphne Blake: It's so impressive that Eric recieve a grand for his computer project.
Fred Jones: Doesn't surprise me. Back at high school they practically lived in a computer lab. Right, Velma?
Velma Dinkley: Yep, he's one smart cookie.
Scooby-Doo: Cookie? Cookie!
Velma Dinkley: Sorry, Scooby. Figure of speech.
Scooby-Doo: Aww.
Shaggy Rogers: Cheer up, Scoob. When we get there, we'll get to play the game Eric designed. I bet it's way cooler than this one.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, cooler!
Fred Jones: Imagine a computer game starting all of us.
Velma Dinkley: Solving mysteries in cyber chase.
(As Shaggy continues playing his video game his player got destroy by the evil ship as it shows "GAME OVER")

Shaggy Rogers: Like I hope I do better on Eric's game than this one.
(The gang laughs as we cut to the state university)

Officer: Hey!
(They stopped and see an officer)

Officer: Where do you think your going?
Velma Dinkley: To visit our friend Eric Staufer. He's a student here.
Officer: Not if you're not on my list.
Fred Jones: It should be under "Fred Jones".
Officer: Is this whole group with you?
Fred Jones: Yes, sir.
Officer: Including the dog?
Scooby-Doo: Dog? Where?
Officer: There you are. But just so you know......I don't like a bunch of punks running around my university.
Daphne Blake: Your university?
(While Officer Wembly is still talking, Scooby takes his hat and starting copying him)

Officer Wembly: It might as well be. I've been here for 20 years. And there's never been any trouble on my watch. I'm the head of security. Wembley's the name.
(Velma, Daphne, and Fred quietly giggles at Scooby and Scooby laughs quietly)

Velma Dinkley: Twenty years is an impressive record.
Officer Wembly: You bet it is. I want to make sure that it stays...
(He realizes his hat is gone and then spots Scooby with his hat. Scooby-Doo giggles)

Officer Wembly: A wise guy, eh? I'm keeping a special eye on you, pooch!
Scooby-Doo: Rooch?
Shaggy Rogers: Like, Scooby's just playing, officer.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, sorry.
Fred Jones: We just need some help finding the computer lab.
Officer Wembly: The lab is three buildings down on the left.
Fred Jones: Thanks.
Officer Wembly: And keep your dog off the grass.
Scooby-Doo: Huh? (Scoffs)
(Scooby leaves as well as Officer Wembly does)

Daphne Blake: Wow, Eric, this lab is one groovy setup.
Eric Staufer: Yeah. We like it too.
(Shaggy and Scooby are about to eat tomatoes)

Bill McLemore: You don't want to eat those. Because they're grown in radioactive soil.
Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks!
(Shaggy rubs his hands on his shirt and Scooby does the same thing too)

Eric Staufer: Everyone, this is my lab partner, Bill McLemore.
Fred Jones: Nice to meet you.
Velma Dinkley: Thanks for keeping Shaggy and Scooby from glowing in the dark.
Eric Staufer: We'll go to dinner after the tour.
Shaggy Rogers: But first, can you show us your new video game? Scoob and I have been dying to play it.
Professor Kaufman: No one is playing the game until we get rid of our problem.
Eric Staufer: Professor Kaufman, I'd like you to meet the mystery gang I based my game on.
Fred, Daphne and Velma: Oh, hi!
Fred Jones: Nice to meet you.
Professor Kaufman: The famous Mystery, Inc.
Shaggy Rogers: And that's Scooby-Doo.
(Scooby begins to mess around with the glass seeing funny faces)

Professor Kaufman: Yes, well. It looks like you showed up just in time for a mystery.
Velma Dinkley: A mystery?
Fred Jones: Why? What happened?
Eric Staufer: This is a hyper-energy laser. We've been using it to break down actual objects and project them into cyberspace.
Velma Dinkley: Jinkies! You mean you can transport objects from the real world into the computer world?
Professor Kaufman: Precisely, young lady.
Daphne Blake: That's fantastic!
Eric Staufer: It was, until the laser beamed a monster into our world last night.
Shaggy and Scooby: A monster?!
(They run off and then hide behind the desk)

Eric Staufer: Yes, the laser beamed a computer virus right here into this lab.
Bill McLemore: A really freaky-looking thing.
Eric Staufer: He wipped out all the data from our computers by just walking near them.
Professor Kaufman: This virus is also able to control and manipulate electrical objects.
Daphne Blake: But where did it come from?
Bill McLemore: Eric's computer game.
Velma Dinkley: Computer viruses don't just appear. They have to be created by someone.
Eric Staufer: But I didn't create it!
Professor Kaufman: I'm sure it wasn't Mr. Staufer here. But whoever created this virus is in serious trouble. Our civilization is so dependent on technology...... (Grabs the broken phone and throws it in the garbage) that this virus is a threat to the entire world.
Fred Jones: Can you show us how the laser works?
Professor Kaufman: You can show them the demo, but don't start the game!
Eric Staufer: Yes, sir.
(Eric programs his computer screen to show the video game)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, check it out! We're digital!
Scooby-Doo: Yeah! Digital!
Eric Staufer: We used the game to extrapolate 3-D data into quantum particles. From there, it's child's play to reintegrate molecular structure in virtual space.
Velma Dinkley: Of course, it's so simple!
All: It is?
Velma Dinkley: He used the Scooby game as the location in cyberspace to store physical objects.
Daphne Blake: And you're sure the virus came from the game?
Eric Staufer: Unfortunately, yes.
Bill McLemore: There's no virus in my baseball game, and it's more entertaining.
(Bill plays the game)

Computer voice: Batter up! Strike one!
Bill: Now, this is a game you can get into.
Fred Jones: That's really cool, Bill. I'm a huge baseball fan myself.
Bill: McLemore You have good taste, Fred and Takuya. I think it's the greatest sport in the world.
Shaggy Rogers: Baseball's okay...... but it doesn't have Scooby and me in it.
Scooby-Doo: That's right!
Eric Staufer: The Scooby game has 10 levels. You battle monsters or villains while trying to find Scooby Snacks on each level.
Scooby-Doo: Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks!
Eric Staufer: Okay, Professor.
(They activate the laser and they beamed the Scooby-Snacks and it disappeared)

Bill McLemore: Now, check out the monitor.
(Then the Scooby Snacks appeared on the monitor screen)

Fred Jones: Cool!
Velma Dinkley: Jinkies!
Daphne Blake: I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes!
Shaggy Rogers: Like, I don't believe it either. We didn't even get one Scooby Snack.
Professor Kaufman: Eric and Bill are sure to win the $250,000 grand prize...... at the international science fair.
Fred Jones: Wow, that's some prize.
Professor Kaufman: It'll be a reward for their talent and hard work on the laser project.
Eric Staufer: We couldn't have done it without you, Professor Kaufman. You should share the reward too.
Professor Kaufman: No, no. As a teacher, being able to guide young minds......to their full potential is reward enough, Eric.
Shaggy Rogers: Speaking of rewards, is it possible to get the Scooby Snacks out of the game?
(Eric then programs the laser to get the Scooby Snacks out of the game, and back into the real world.)

Shaggy Rogers: Groovy!
Scooby-Doo: Oh, boy!
(They rush to the Scooby Snacks and fight over it)

Shaggy Rogers: Hey, that's mine!
Scooby-Doo: No, mine!
Shaggy Rogers: Mine!
Fred Jones: Is that the way the virus came out of the game, Eric?
Eric Staufer: Yeah. It was pretty scary.
Daphne Blake: If it's just a computer virus, what harm can it do in our world?
Professor Kaufman: From what we observed the last night, this virus has the potential to steal every computer program in the world.
Bill McLemore: And the virus made the telephone come to life, which attacked Eric.
(Eric pulled down his sleeve to show everyone a bandage on his arm as they gasp in horror then the flashback starts)

Bill McLemore: It kept coming toward us and we couldn't stop it.
(Professor Kaufman through a stapler at it but it has no effect)

Professor Kaufman: When I held up a magnetic bar in defense...... (The virus gets scared) it seemed to have an adverse effect on the virus.
(He points the magnet to the virus and it weakened him)

Bill McLemore: Yeah. It seemed like the magnet weakened him. Like kryptonite to Superman.
(The Phantom Virus flees as the flashback ends)

Velma Dinkley: Wow!
Daphne Blake: Creepy!
Bill McLemore: The security guards checked the campus, but couldn't find him anywhere.
Professor Kaufman: I suspect that he is still in this building somewhere.
Scooby and Shaggy: Still here? (gulp)
Velma Dinkley: No more arguing, boys.
Scooby and Shaggy: Uh?
Velma Dinkley: So what can we do to help, Eric?
Eric Staufer: If you can lure the Phantom Virus into the lab......I can use the laser to beam him back into cyberspace.
Shaggy Rogers: Great. Like, you want us to be virus bait? Like, no way, man.
Scooby-Doo: Uh-uh.
Velma Dinkley: Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, yeah.
Shaggy Rogers: Hold on, Scoob. Only one Scooby Snack to go chase a phantom? I don't think so.
Velma Dinkley: What if I gave you each two Scooby Snacks?
Shaggy Rogers: Okay, you got a deal.
Velma Dinkley: Go long, guys!
(She throws them in the air and Scooby and Shaggy catches them with their mouths and eats them)

Shaggy Rogers: This place is so big, we'll probably never see this virus anyway.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah.
Velma Dinkley: How do we capture the Phantom Virus once we find him?
Professor Kaufman: The Phantom Virus is composed of electromagnetic energy. Get close enough to him with one of these super-magnets......and it will render him helpless.
(The strong gravity lifts the paper pins as Scooby flees in terror and hides under the desk)

Velma Dinkley: Be careful, Scooby. Those are pretty strong magnets.
Scooby-Doo: Sorry!
Fred Jones: Now let's really put them to the test.
Eric Staufer: I knew I could count on you guys.
***
Shaggy Rogers: I think I saw a vending machine down the hall. What is it, Scoob? Oh, hello, Mr. Phantom. Zoinks!
***
Shaggy Rogers: Thank you for volunteering for our experiment, Mr. Virus.
***
Scooby-Doo: Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks!
***
Daphne: What happened to-- What?
***
Fred: Wow, that guy is really clobbering the ball.

Shaggy: Hey, man. Great swing.

Phantom: Thanks! Want my autograph? Let’s play ball!

(He swings the balls at the gang)

Fred Jones: Everybody make a run for the video arcade!

(The gang runs as fast as they can until they bumped into something revealed to be Creeper)

Creeper: Creeper!

Daphne Blake: Jeepers! It’s the Creeper!

Cyber-Velma: The what?

Fred Jones: He’s one of the villains from our past.

Shaggy Rogers: And he’s got a pet.

(Jaguaro appears)

Velma Dinkley: It’s Jaguaro. He’s supposed to be in Brazil.

(The gang backs off and then Fred bumps into Tar Monster and turns)

Fred Jones: Gator Ghoul and the Tar Monster?

(Gator Ghoul also appeared as well)

Cyber-Fred: Head for the beach!

Scooby-Doo: No way.

Cyber-Scooby-Doo: Look!

Shaggy Rogers: It’s Old Iron Face! Man, you guys know some strange people. It’s like every villain we’ve ever faced is here! Maybe we shouldn’t have told Eric so much about our mysteries. How right you are, my dear. Wait a minute. All these creatures in the real world turned out to be just people in costumes. Velma’s right. They were all fakes. Nice try, Phantom Virus. But you can’t fool us. Tough time with the mask, guys? He’s real!

Daphne: That means that they’re all real! Creeper! Yikes! Get them! Let’s split up, gang. - Right. - Okay, Freddy. Step right up and test your strength. How about you, handsome? - Me? - Yes, you, sir! Let us show you how easy it is. Creepy. Why’d you pick this place to hide? Me? I was following you. If you thought this wasn’t a good place, you should’ve said something. Where did that come from? These fun houses have all sorts of trap doors. Let’s keep an eye open for more. Oh, no! What’s wrong? - Look how fat I am! - It’s just a trick mirror. - You look perfect. - Oh, thanks. You too.

Creeper: Creeper!

***

Shaggy Rogers: The Tar Monster is right behind us.

Cyber-Shaggy: And boy, is he mad!

Fred: Let’s get out of here! Look. - Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! - Scooby-Doos! - Where are you? I wonder where they are. - Over here. - There they are! Come on, Scooby. Now that we’re all here, we’ve got one last monster to face. The Phantom Virus. And this is the final level, so the virus won’t be easy to beat. What’s this? Zoinks! I’ve still got the magnet Professor Kaufman gave me. You had that magnet with you all this time and forgot about it? Guess I was too busy being scared. What’s wrong with cyber-Shag? What’s going on here? The cyber-gang is made of electromagnetic energy and therefore affected by the magnet. Just like the Phantom Virus. - What’s this about a magnet? - We have a way to beat the virus now. And we know he’s guarding the Scooby Snacks in there. - We need your gang to stay here. - You don’t want us help to help you? We wouldn’t want you to get hurt by the magnet again. - Magnet? What are you talking about? - Oh, never mind. Man, this is one great video arcade. - Just keep an eye open for the virus. - Look. There’s the Scooby-Doo video game. - And the Scooby Snacks! - Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks! Yikes! Like, I hear him, but I don’t see him. Ready to play some games? Shaggy, the magnet! Oh, right! - You need to get closer! - Like, that’s easy for you to say. - Then toss the magnet over here. - With pleasure. Hey, Mr. Zappy! It’s working! Scooby, go grab the snacks. Okay. Hurry, Scooby! I don’t know how much longer this is gonna work! Oh, no! Oh, tough break. - Freddy! - Freddy! Not again! If you thought my hitting was good… …wait till you see my pitching. What do we do now? - Looks like they’re in trouble! - Like, we’ve gotta do something. Right! Let’s go help them. Oh, no! They’re back! Oh, no! Scooby? - Cyber-Scooby?

Cyber Scooby: "Rhat’s right!"

Fred Jones: "It’s no use. We need some wire cutters." (He sees the Scooby Snax box next to the damaged arcade game.) "I got an idea. Want to help?"

Cyber Scooby: "Rokay."

Fred Jones: "Great. Here’s the plan." (He whispers his plan into Cyber Scooby's ear.)

(Scooby shivers under the air hockey table, until Cyber-Scooby crawls next to him.)

Scooby-Doo: "Ruh?"

Cyber Scooby: (whispering Fred's plan into Scooby's ear)

Scooby-Doo: "Ruh-huh!" (He sneaks off to get the Scooby Snax.)

Cyber Scooby: (to the Phantom Virus) "Roo-hoo! Rover here!"

(The Phantom Virus begins flinging electric balls at Cyber Scooby, who dodges them like an Olympic athlete.)

Velma Dinkley: (mistaking Cyber Scooby for the real Scooby) "What are you doing, Scooby?"

Daphne Blake: (mistaking Cyber Scooby for the real Scooby as well) "Scooby, get back here!"

Phantom Virus: "You’re down to your final out!" (He tosses another blast of electricity at Cyber Scooby, who somersaults from the blast and blows the Phantom Virus a raspberry.)

Shaggy Rogers: "I’ve never seen Scooby so brave." (He sees Cyber Scooby holding off the Phantom Virus and the real Scooby sneaking over to the Scooby Snax box, thus getting the connection.) "Oh, I get it! That’s Cyber-Scooby. And that’s old Scoob going for the snacks."

Phantom Virus: "Meddling canine!" (He zaps a pair of pinball machines into life, and they wrap up Cyber Scooby in their wires.)

Cyber Scooby: (scared) "Rikes! Relp!"

Fred Jones: "Oh, no!"

Daphne & Velma: (gasping)

(The Phantom Virus cackles wickedly. Unfortunately for him, he looks on with horror as he sees the real Scooby grabbing the Scooby Snax box at last! Scooby laughs triumphantly.)

Phantom Virus: (in pain) "Noooooo!" (He begins disintegrating.)

Shaggy: (giving a short pant) "All right, Scoob!"

(The Phantom Virus screams and bends his neck in pain. At the same time, the arcade game wires slither away from Fred's ankles.)

Fred Jones: (triumphantly) "Yes!"

(The pinball game wires slither away from Cyber Scooby as well.)

Cyber Scooby: (relieved) "Rhew!"

(The gang comes out of their hiding places and watches the sports balls and bowling pins fall on the floor. Outside the arcade, the Creeper, Phantom Jaguar, Gator Ghoul, the Tar Monster, and Iron Face, preparing to destroy the Cyber Gang, vanish into thin air.)

Cyber Gang: (confused) "Huh?" (They realize that the real gang's won the game.)

(Back inside the arcade, the Phantom Virus vanishes, as the real gang watches the last trace of his static. The Cyber Gang comes in to check on the real Mystery Inc. gang.)

Cyber Fred: "You did it! You beat the Phantom Virus."

Cyber Shaggy Rogers: Nice job, guys!

(Two Scooby's eats the box of Scooby-Snax as the arcade game background changes to outside of the carnival as the digital wormhole appears)

Fred Jones: Looks like we're leaving.

(The green grid is starting to gain power)

Cyber-Shaggy: Are you sure you want to split? There's a lot of cyber-buffets to try.

Scooby-doo: Yeah! Okay!

Velma Dinkley: Sorry, but we have to go.

(Then, the green grid opened up a portal to the real world)

Cyber-Velma Dinkley: I guess this is goodbye.

All: Bye!

Daphne Blake: Thanks for all the help!

(The original gang enters the portal as it closes)

Cyber-Scooby-Doo: Bye, Scooby.

(Now on Earth, the gang appeared back in the lab)

Eric Staufer: You're back! I thought you'll be stuck in the game forever.

Shaggy Rogers: There's no place like home.

Officer Wembly: Everyone okay?

Velma Dinkley: I think so.

Professor Kaufman: Well done! You've saved the world from a terrible menace.

Bill McLemore: But did you find out who created the virus?

Fred Jones: We've got a pretty good idea.

Professor Kaufman: Good. Because whoever created the virus must be punished.

Velma Dinkley: Glad you agree, Professor, because you're as much a suspect as anyone here.

Professor Kaufman: What? Me? But I'm a scientist! I've dedicated my life to my students and this university.

Fred Jones: But you also stood to make $250,000 at the science fair.

Daphne Blake: If you stole the invention.

Professor Kaufman: Preposterous!

Shaggy Rogers: And let's not forget Officer Wembley.

Officer Wembly: What? I'm an officer of the law! Sort of. Anyway, I've never committed a crime in my life!

Fred Jones: But, you were the only person that was with us in the lab when we got sent into the game.

Velma Dinkley: But once inside the game, we found some important clues.

Daphne Blake: Our first clue came when we were on the moon level. The Phantom Virus shouted, "Play ball!"

Fred Jones: And on the Colosseum level, we found some chalk lines like a large diamond.

Velma Dinkley: But our biggest clue was on the final level.

Fred Jones: When the Phantom Virus and the villains appeared in a batting cage.

Eric Staufer: All I get is the virus and the villains have a thing for... baseball!

(Bill tries to open the door)

Eric Staufer: Bill!

Officer Wembly: Not so fast kid!

(Bill runs trying to escape but gets blocked by the gang, and Officer Wembly comes to arrest Bill, then Scooby trips Bill and he falls against the bookshelf)

Officer Wembly: Okay, son, it's all over. (He arrest him)

Eric Staufer: Bill, you were my best friend.

Professor Kaufman: And my best student.

Bill McLemore: But you didn't pick my project.

Eric Staufer: What's that supposed to mean?

Bill McLemore: Professor Kaufman chose your video design over mine even though I've been here 2 years longer.

Professor Kaufman: Students are all equal, Bill.

Velma Dinkley: So you invented the Phantom Virus, hoping it would scare Eric away.

Bill McLemore: That's right. And it worked, till you guys showed up.

Fred Jones: You were afraid that we would find out who created the virus.

Shaggy Rogers: So you beamed us into cyberspace.

Bill McLemore: The prize would've been all mine, if it wasn't for...

All: Us meddling kids!

(Everyone laughs)
