Scene 1
(We see a lake near a city called Veracruz, there was the Plaza where there was people and a mirachi band and we see a man playing the Marimba and his son a toy marimba and with his chihuahua dancing and heard a sound from the alley and chases it)
Jorge Otero: Chiquita! (He run towards her and follows her, later a man is still playing but noticed his son is missing)
Alejo Otero: Jorge?! Jorge! Jorgito! (He runs off to find Jorge)
(Later, Chiquita follows the shadow through the alley and catches her breath at the pier she looks around and sees a light green glow and sees a monster while Jorge picks her up and sees the monster, they were frightened and ran off then Alejo picked them up)
Alejo Otero: El Chupacabra! (They ran away as fast they can and made it back to the Plaza and ran to tell the people) El Chupacabra! El Chupacabra!
(People heard about it and ran and scream then the screen turns to black and a title says "Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico" with green eyes going around the opening credits)

Scene 2
Fred Jones (voice mail): Alright. You got mail!

Alejo Otero: (voice mail) Dear Fred, it is so peaceful and serene here in Mexico now that the rainy season has ended. I would love for you and your friends to enjoy a relaxing stay with my family here in Veracruz. It’ll be great to finally meet my American pen pal.

Fred Jones: Sounds great. And I can practice my Spanish. (He types on his computer)

(Later we see an ad called "Ricky’s" from a computer from Daphne’s)

Daphne Blake (voice mail): Jeepers! You got mail!

(Then she checks her mail)

Fred Jones: I thought I can reach to your computer so what so you think?

Daphne Blake: Of course, I have to go to Mexico, yes. I I mean "si." Let’s ask Velma.

(Later Velma is looking at an ad about laser eye surgery)

Velma Dinkley (voice mail): Jinkies, you have mail.

(Then Velma looked at her mail)

Velma Dinkley: Mexico? The art, the mesuems, the pyramids. I’m there.

Fred Jones: Great! Let’s check with the guys.

(We see inside a microwave is a pizza where it was open by Shaggy and Scooby)

Shaggy Rogers (voice mail): Zoinks, like you have mail.

(They go the computer, as Scooby ate all the pizza they’d fixed, as he goes back the computer, and then Shaggy looks at the email)

Shaggy Rogers: Mexico? Tomorrow? Like, let me check. What do we got, Scoob? Let’s see. Daydreaming at 10, napping, snoozing, relaxing call. (laughs) Like sorry guys, looks like I’m booked.

Scooby-Doo: Reah, rooked.

(Shaggy and Scooby laughs)

Velma Dinkley: Do you realize we’ll be there for the annual of the Day of the Dead celebration?

(Shaggy and Scooby got worried)

Shaggy Rogers: Like what’s that?

Velma Dinkley: A holiday in which family gather at the cemetery and celebrat their ancestors, who are allow to come back to earth for two days.

(Shaggy and Scooby got scared)

Shaggy Rogers: C-c-c-cemetery? Sounds scary.

(Then Scooby hides in the dresser, as the scenes goes to Velma typing)

Velam Dinkley: Not at all, just a bunch of kids in costumes, lots of skeleton shaped cookies and candies.

Daphne Blake: Basically, it’s nonstop eating.

Shaggy Rogers: Sounds like Halloween.

Velma Dinkley: Actually

Daphne: So what do you say?

Shaggy Rogers: Can’t talk now guys like Scoob and I got to pack.

(They go and pack the food, in the suitcase, And they close the suitcase)

Shaggy Rogers: Looks like that’s everything.

Scooby-Doo: Nah-huh. (He goes off)

Shaggy Rogers: Like what did I forget? (Then, Scooby got the salsa) Salsa.

(Later on the road, the Mystery Machine riding along with the gang.)

Scene 3
(Later the Mystery Machine is heading towards to the small house and they arrived)

Shaggy Rogers: Are you sure this is the place?

Fred Jones: (checks the paper) Yep, this is it.

Shaggy Rogers: Looks kinda…

Daphne Blake: Quaint?

Shaggy Rogers: Small.

(A door opens and reveals to be Alejo Otero)

Alejo Otero: ¡Hola, mis amigos! Welcome to Mexico!

Everyone: Hey, how are you?

Alejo Otero: You must be Fred.

Fred Jones: That’s right, and you must be Alejo. Let me introduce you to the gang and my friends. These are…..

Alejo Otero: No need. They are exactly what you describe, Daphne, Velma, Señor Scooby… (Scooby gives a grin) Is this Shaggy? (Shaggy smiles, too) He doesn’t look like he can eat you out of house and home.

Fred Jones: He’s got a high metabolism. (Alejo understood)

Alejo Otero: Please, let me introduce you to my family. (They’ve follow Alejo and he looks back and sees the gang in a cabin)

Fred Jones: Wow, isn’t this where you live?

Alejo Otero: No. These are just the guests’ cottages. You and your friends will have your own. This is where we live. (He shows them a beautiful hotel with pine trees and a pool) Welcome to my family’s hotel, La Villa Bella.

Fred Jones: Wow, it’s beautiful. What does bella mean?

Alejo Otero: Beautiful.

Fred Jones: Oh, well, (laughs nervously) La Villa Bella is very bella. (Scooby leans on Fred’s shoulder)

Scooby-Doo: Reah, rery rella.

Alejo Otero: Please, let me show you around. (He goes to a young woman sitting on the edge of the pool and old lady sitting on a chair and introduces them) This is my wife, Sofia and my mother, Doña Dolores.

Doña Dolores: ¡Bienvenidos!

Sofia Otero: Welcome!

Alejo Otero: And in the pool are the rest of my family, (breathes) Jorge, Oliver, Natalia, Cristina, Fernanda, Carolina, Mirelia, Gabriella, and Sabestian.

Jorge Otero: (Jorge pets Chiquita) And this is Chiquita. (Scooby looks and lies to see her romantically)

Fred Jones: Wow. Are they all your children? (Alejo and Sofia look and laugh)

Alejo Otero: No, no, no. Only Jorgito. The rest are just visiting for the Day of the Dead festivities. Here in Mexico, family is muy importante. (He holds Sofia)

Sofia Otero: You must be hot and tired after your long trip. Please, feel free to join the children in the pool.

Scooby-Doo: Yeah! (He runs as the gang look surprised and Scooby goes up the diving board and jumps off, but hits the surface too hard and sinks. Jorge and Chiquita laughed after that, then Chiquita was surprised when her ears went up and Scooby pops on top of her)

Sofia Otero: I think Scooby has already won someone’s heart.

(Scooby swims with Chiquita on top of his head, later at the Café, we see Alejo wrapping his arm around the shoulder of a man with a white shirt and blue blazer)

Alejo Otero: My older brother, Luis manages the café with his fiancée, Charlene.

(Then a woman with bushy blonde hair comes out)

Charlene: Howdy! Let me grab y’all a cup of Café lechera while you take hoot.

(Luis looks romantically at Charlene)

Luis Otero: You can see why I feel, how do you Americans say? "Head over heels" for Charlene. I met her on my last trip to the United States at Mr. Smiley’s Fantastic Funland, and I’ve been smiling ever since. (Charlene brings two pitchers) You know, Café lechera is famous in Veracruz. First, One server serves you thick coffee then the custom is to bang on your glass with your spoon until another server pours you hot milk in your glass.

Charlene: Ain’t that a hoot? I love these Loco customs. "Loco"; that’s crazy in "Mexican". I mean Spanish.

Scooby-Doo: Yeah! (Charlene gives Scooby a bowl of café lechera and Scooby tastes a drop then coffee beans fell into his bowl) Huh?

Charlene: (laughs) You know, some days I grind so many coffee beans, I swear the little suckers are coming out of my ears! (Scooby drinks the café lechera and has a mouthful of milk in his face and licks it and smiles)

Velma Dinkley: It didn’t take Scooby to start livin’ "La vida mocha".

(Later, outside the gang and Alejo’s family are eating lunch)

Daphne Blake: This lunch is really wonderful, Doña Dolores.

Shaggy Rogers: Yeah, whoever came up with this whole fiesta tradition is okay in my book. (Scooby tried to eat the whole plate, but Shaggy eats it quick with Scooby upset)

Alejo Otero: It is often followed by another tradition La siesta, an afternoon nap.

Shaggy Rogers: (laughs) Even better!

Scooby-Doo: Reah! Reven retter!

Velma Dinkley: The purpose of fiestas and siestas Shaggy, is to provide sustenance and rest for another tradition: hard work.

Shaggy Rogers: Traditions, like who needs em?

Scooby-Doo: Yuck!

(Everyone laughs, later an old man in a uniform comes in)

Old Man: Um, forgive me for interrupting your meal, Doña Dolores, but I need to discuss some urgent business with your sons. (Dolores wipes her mouth with a napkin)

Doña Dolores: As you wish.

Alejo Otero: Excuse us, please. This won’t take long.

Doña Dolores: Diego Fuente used to do business with my late husband. I don’t trust him. Never did. He is a… How do you say it in America?

Fred Jones: Crook?

Daphne Blake: Liar?

Velma Dinkley: Con man?

(Dolores smiles and puts her hands up)

Doña Dolores: Jerk!

(Later with Alejo, Luis, Charlene and Diego)

Alejo Otero: For the last time, I told you no. Now please leave, we have guests. (He walks as Diego follows him)

Diego Fuente: I’m apologize for the disturbance. Please, finish your meal.

(He then leaves)

Alejo Otero: That man is stubborn as a bull. He wants to buy our father’s land and won’t take "no" for an answer.

Luis Otero: Maybe it’s not such a bad idea, Alejo. Putting all your assets into land is foolish.

Alejo Otero: We made a promise to papa before he died! And I don’t in tempt to break it now!

Sofia Otero: So how will you and your friends be spending your day in Veracruz?

Velma Dinkley: We were hoping to watch the preparations of Day of the Dead festivities.

Doña Dolores: If anyone is out there alive to honor the dead.

(That made Scooby and Shaggy scared)

Charlene: Have you all heard about the monster?

(Suddenly, a thunderstorm came and rain pour down as the others head inside.)

Scene 4
(Later inside the empty hotel lobby with the gang, Tino and his friends and Alejo and his family)

Alejo Otero: You may not be noticed right now, that our hotel is reluctantly empty. That’s because a monster has been terrorizing Veracruz and the near by villages. Right after I sent my email to you, the monster showed up near the plaza and nearly got Jorgito.

(Shaggy and Scooby gulbed)

Alejo Otero: I’d desperately emailed you again, to warn you. But you must have already left.

Shaggy Rogers: Did you say m-m-m-monster?

Alejo Otero: Yes, the locals call him, El Chupacabra.

Velma Dinkley: I’ve read about him, he’s Mexico’s version of the Bigfoot.

Scooby-Doo: Rigfoot.

Luis Otero: That’s right.

Alejo Otero: I’ve known not to be a suspicious man, but I saw it with my own eyes down by the warf. I can never forget it. It stand about nearly 10 feet tall, and walks on two hind legs, it was covered with thick fur, has a face of an hideous monkey with huge claws and sharp fangs, and his eyes glow green like those of a demon.

(Then, the fire burnt Shaggy and Scooby’s marshmallows, as they cry in fear)

Fred: Hey, hey, calm down everyone. The chupacabra’s only a myth.

Alejo Otero: Yes, let’s forget a Chupacabra and make the most to your first visit to Mexico.

Sofia Otero: Why don’t we all get a good night sleep? Eh.

Alejo Otero: Yes, there’s nothing to worry about.

Daphne Blake: Alejo's right.

Luis Otero: But just in case, double lock your doors.

Charlene: Say your prayers.

Luis Otero: But whatever you do…

Luis & Charlene: Don’t go outside.

(Later that night)

Shaggy Rogers: Like whoever heard such a ridiculous story. A ten-foot hairy monster with big feet and sharp teeth? Sounds like something out of the cartoon. Like pleasent dream Scoob. (Yawns) See you in the morning.

Scooby-Doo: Yeah.

(Suddenly they heard a noise)

Shaggy Rogers: This is gonna be a long night.

Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh.

(The noise gets louder and Shaggy and Scooby get scared and go under the cover)

Shaggy Rogers: Listen Scoob. Something's coming from out of the window. It might be a little bird or a squirrel.

(Scooby whimpers and they hear a roar, as they run around the room panicking)

Shaggy Rogers: El caba-choo-choo! I mean, la kooka-babka! El popa-choopa!No I mean! HELP!!

(Shaggy opens the door and Fred was in front, but Shaggy closes the door back)

Shaggy Rogers: No Scoob! He's trying to break in! Like we're trapped! Let's get of here!

(He goes up the chimney, and Scooby baracaded the door, and he goes with Shaggy as they go to the rooftop and they almost fall off and they see Fred, Velma, and the others.)

Fred Jones: What happened to you two?

Velma Dinkley: And what was all that noise?

(Shaggy and Scooby falls off the rooftop)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, that big Mexican bigfoot was trying to get us!

Fred Jones: Oh, no! Where's Daphne?

(Now we go to Daphne sleeping in their room with a pair of green eyes. Then Ron, Rufus, Alex, Scooby and Shaggy tried to chicken out)

Velma Dinkley: Oh no you don't. This is no time to be chicken. It's all for one and one for all.

Shaggy Rogers: Like I always felt teamwork was highly overrated.

Scooby-Doo: Reah.

Fred Jones: Okay, guys. On the count of three, we run to the door. Ready? One. Two. Three!

Everyone: CHARGE!!!

(They ran to the door as Daphne opens the door)

Fred Jones: We thought those were the eyes of the El Chupacabra.

Daphne Blake: Sorry guys, I was afraid to go to sleep and thought some Latin rhythms might calm me down. Looks like Alejo's story rolded everyone.

Shaggy Rogers: Does anybody got a bandage?

(They go outside)

Fred Jones: Don't know what you heard guys, but I think we're save. Let's all try get some- Hey, wait a minute. What's this?

Daphne Blake: Footprints. Big ones.

Shaggy Rogers: Don't look, Scoob. Or we'll never get to sleep.

Velma Dinkey: Notice how they lead to the cottage window. Then reverse direction and head off towards the hotel. We must have scared whatever it was away.

Fred Jones: It was brave enough when we were seperated, but got scared at the thought of a bunch of us to contend with. Not a very couragous monster.

Velma Dinkey: Well, whatever it is, it's gone. Maybe now we can all get some sleep.

(Velma went inside her stateroom)

Fred Jones: We're gonna need it. We got a big day tomorrow.

Shaggy Rogers: Yeah, sightseeing and chocolate bean tamales! (laughs) Can't wait!

Scooby-Doo: Yeah.

(They walk away)

Fred Jones: Uh, that's not exactually what I meant, Shaggy.

(They stopped for a sec)

Fred Jones: We got a mystery on our hands.

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks!

(In the morning)

Fred Jones: And whatever it was, we'd scared it away.

Daphne Blake: I got up early, and using my mud mask made a cast of the footprint from Bigfoot's big foot. (show's the cast) Look!

Alejo Otero: Wow. It's huge!

Luis Otero: And look, it is speckled with some kind of gritty black stuff.

Fred Jones: Is it dirt?

Velma Dinkley: I don't think so. I don't know what it is.

Alejo Otero: Whatever it is, please do not mention it to my mother or Sofia.

Luis Otero: Or Charlene. I don't want to scare them.

Alejo Otero: In fact, I better alert the security guards to be especially vigilant.

Luis Otero: If word of this gets out we will lose the few tourists we have managed to keep. El Chupacabra could ruin our livelihood not to mention everyone else's in Veracruz.

Fred Jones: Don't worry. No matter how huge ferocious or bloodthirsty this vicious Chupacabra monster may be We'll get to the bottom of the mystery.

Daphne Blake: You can count on us, right, gang?

(Shaggy closes the door as Scooby looks at the paw and looks scared and faints as he falls down, Chiquita tries to wake Scooby up, but didn't work so she fans him as Scooby regains consciousness and they looked at each other romantically. Later as we see the gang, Tino and his friends, Alejo and Luis in the Mystery Machine ready to leave as Fred pulls out a Spanish dictionary)

Fred Jones: Um, Muchas gracias para su hospital y cometas.

(This made Dolores, and Sofia confused as Alejo laughs)

Fred Jones: What's so funny?

Alejo Otero: You just thanked my family for their generous hospital and delicious comets.

(Fred gave a sheepish smile)

Charlene: Oops, I almost forgot. (goes to Luis) I know this is silly, but this is a good luck charm. With that big ole' Bigfoot thing out there you can't be to careful. (puts on the medallion on Luis) Promise me that you'll never take it off. (kisses Luis on the check)

Luis Otero: Si, Charlene. I promise.

(Chiquita leaps on the Mystery Machine and barks and Scooby bends down and they rub noses then the Mystery Machine drives off as Dolores, Sofia, Jorge, Charlene, and Chiquita wave goodbye as the screen fades to black)

Scene 5
(Later at the village)

Alejo Otero: As you can see, there aren't many tourist here since the Chupacabra iccident. This place is usually very busy this time of year.

Fred Jones: I've got an idea. Why don't we ask the locals about the monster.

Velma Dinkley: Good idea, Fred. We can videotape them.

Daphne Blake: Great! I'll be the reporter.

(They get into position)

Fred Jones: And action!

Daphne Blake: A seesaw, a jungle gym, a merry-go-round. At first glance, this modest playground looks like any other. But the children here in Veracruz are fearful and have good reason to be. El Chupacabra. Imaginary Bigfoot? Or big scary monster that could bite your head off? You decide. What does El Chupacabra look like?

Kid 1: A gorilla!

Kid 2: A bear!

Kid 3: An alien!

Daphne Blake: What does El Chupacabra do?

Painter 1: Eats goats!

Painter 2: Destroys crops!

Girl: He's a bully!

Daphne Blake: What does El Chupacabra sound like?

Musician: Like a coyote!

Mexican Lady: Like a ape!

Musician: Like my Uncle Flaco!

Daphne Blake: What does he smell like?

Musician: Like sulphur!

Mexican Lady: Like garbage!

Musician: Like my Uncle Flaco!

Daphne Blake: Will he show up tomorrow at the Day of the Dead festivities... or will he remain as elusive as the Loch Ness monster? Or the perfect boyfriend? This is Daphne Blake in Veracruz reporting. Back to you, Velma.

Fred Jones: And cut!

Velma Dinkley: "Back to you"?

(Later at the Mystery Machine)

Fred Jones: Oh no!

Alejo Otero: "¡Sal ahora o no veras el día de mañana!"

Shaggy Rogers: Yikes, what's that mean in English?

Fred Jones: Leave today or you won't see tomorrow. Does that right Alejo?

Alejo Otero: Unforturnally, your translation is correct.

Shaggy Rogers: Looks like somebody wants us to make like a piñata and beat it.

Daphne Blake: We better get out of here now.

(Shaggy an Scooby looked at each other, and then go inside the Mystery Machine)

Velma Dinkley: Hold on, you two. We came here today to get to the bottom of this Chupacabra mystery.

Fred Jones: And no one's going to scare us away until we do.

Shaggy Rogers: Like, Freddy, it's too late for that.

Velma Dinkley: Looks like they need some friendly persuasion. Would you each do it for a Scooby snack?

(They are shocked, but then Shaggy closes the car window, and they crossed their arms)

Daphne Blake: How about two Scooby snacks?

(As they heard that, they got out and had 2 Scooby Snacks each)

Velma Dinkley: Great! So far, it appears as if the Chupacabra is nocturnal. Now that it's getting dark, we should do a thorough search of the town.

Daphne Blake: Maybe we'll get a clue to help us find the monster or at least the van vandals.

Fred Jones: The girls are right. Alejo and Luis, why don't you investigate the hills? The girls and I will search the west part of town, and Scooby and Shaggy can search the east.

(At night at the East side of town)

Shaggy Rogers: The mystery machine is actually on the east side of town. Why don't we do a thorough search of the van and if everything checks out okay keep guard right here?

Scooby-Doo: Ro-kay!

(They go inside, and they fall asleep. As they sleep, a arm appears and tampered with the brakes, and the brake fluid leaks out)

(Later Alejo and Luis were walking down the woods)

Luis Otero: Hey, escucha. What was that?

(It was an owl)

Alejo Otero: Just an owl. Don't be a baby.

(The owl flies away, ad we get to Fred, Velma, Daphne, Tino and their friends. As they come across a statue of a serpent which scares them)

Fred Jones: (sighs in relief) It's just a statue.

Velma Dinkley: Yes, of Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent. I've read about him. He was revered by the Aztecs as the god of all things good.

Daphne Blake: Look!

(Out of the tent, came a man)

Man: Bienvenido. Welcome.

Daphne Blake: Good, you speak English.

Man: Yes, of course. Please, come in.

(Inside the man's tent)

Velma Dinkley: Wow! Are you a medicine man?

Man: I prefer "curandero". But, yes, medicine man, shaman, and healer all apply. How can I help you?

Velma Dinkley: We were hoping you can tell us something about El Chupacabra.

El Curandero: Like everyone, I have heard the stories about the big-footed beast. But there is nothing in the ancient lore about a monster such as this. Our animal friends don't harm people for no reason.

Fred Jones: Then how do you explain the attacks?

El Curandero:The only evil force in this land is greed.

Velma Dinkley: Greed? But what does this have to do with El Chupacabra?

(Outside the tent, while the curandero is talking, a hand appears, and it seems that the El Chupracabra is spying on them)

El Curandero: Recently, people from the north offered huge sums of money to build businesses here and attract tourists. The locals turned down the offer, but when the strangers left, they vowed to return.

Fred Jones: Um, I see.

Daphne Blake: You do?

El Curandero: The answers to all your questions can be found in the past. And did I also mention you're in grave danger?

Daphne Blake: No, I think you skipped that part.

El Curandero: You're in grave danger.

(The the El Chupracabra leaves)

Velma Dinkley: We better get back to the others and warn them.

(They got out of the tent)​​

El Curandero: Be careful, my friends. In Mexico, things are not always as they seem. If you have any more questions, check out my website at www.ancientmexicanwisdom.com.

Daphne Blake: Website?

El Curandero: As I said, expect the unexpected.

Fred Jones: Muchas gracias para sus palabras... sabias de avestruz.

(The Curandero is confused)

Daphne Blake: What did you say to him?

Fred Jones: I just thanked him for his wise words of advice.

El Curandero: Thanks for your wise words of ostrich? (goes inside his tent) Teenagers. Go figure.

Scene 6
(Cut to Alejo and Luis looking around the woods)

Luis Otero: Alejo! Let's head back. We're getting nowhere!
Alejo Otero: Okay!
(The Alejo hears a sound and then he sees the green eyes)

Alejo Otero: (scared) Luis, come quick! Luis! Luis!
(The creature tries to grab Alejo, but Alejo runs and falls off a cliff and his glasses fall off but he grabs a branch and holds on to it, and the El Chupucabra roars)

(We cut to Shaggy and the others sleeping, then the roar scared and woke them up)

Shaggy Rogers: Do you hear what I hear, Scoob?
Scooby-Doo: Ruh-uh!
Shaggy Rogers: Like, that's not gonna help much. (climbs to the driver's seat) We better get out of here now, or else we become an El Chupacabra fiesta plate.
(They drive off, and the fluid leaks a trail. And we cut to Fred and the others)

Daphne Blake: None of this looks familiar. Are you sure we're going the right way?
Velma Dinkley: That's Polaris, the North Star. We should be headed in the opposite direction.
Fred Jones: Trust me. I know where I'm going.
Daphne Blake: We're sunk.
(Alejo is climbing up the cliff, and then Luis arrives)

Luis Otero: Alejo! What happened? (helps Alejo up from the cliff)
Alejo Otero: I was attacked by El Chupracabra. Did you hear me calling for help?
Luis Otero: No. Something hit me over the head and knocked me out. When I woke up, you were gone.
Alejo Otero: The Chupacabra is still out there and we've got to find the others before he does.
(Cut to town, when Shaggy is driving away)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, the next time we go on a trip, remind me to pick someplace a little less exciting like maybe a librarians' convention?
(They see a red light and Shaggy tries to stop the Mystery Machine, but the brakes aren't working)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! The brake's not working!
(Shaggy and Scooby scream in terror)

Shaggy Rogers: Hold tight, Scoob!
(They drive though as the Mystery Machine goes even faster, and the man and woman sees the van coming and they got out of the way before it passed by.)

Shaggy Rogers: Like how do we stop this thing!?
(They go through the ice cream cart. And they're heading toward the dock, they scream as they go across the water, by bouncing the boat to get to the other side. They look back to see an angry sailor yelling at them.)

(We cut to Fred and the girls lost in the woods)

Daphne Blake: Okay, Fred, how do you say "hopelessly lost" in Spanish?
Velma Dinkley: It looks like the woods get thicker up ahead.
Daphne Blake: Do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Fred Jones: We might.
Velma Dinkley: Mostly coyotes and jaguars and boars.
Daphne Blake: Coyotes?
Fred Jones: And jaguars?
Velma Dinkley: And boars.
Daphne Blake: Oh, my!
(They hear a growling noise ahead, and they got scared)

Fred Jones: Let's get out of here!
(They run away and then they bumped into Alejo and Luis)

Fred Jones: Sorry, guys.
Alejo Otero: No, we're sorry. We were hoping to find you close by, but not that close.
Daphne Blake: We thought we heard El Chupacabra. Listen.
(They hear a animal howl from a distance)

Luis Otero: That is nothing to be afraid of. It is just a coyote.
Alejo Otero: There are lots of them around here. They are more afraid of you than you are of them.
(Then they hear the coyote yell)

Fred Jones: Then why is it headed in our direction?
Alejo Otero: Maybe it is not running towards us, but away from something else.
(A coyote runs pay them)

Daphne Blake: Yeah but what?
Velma Dinkley: Like maybe that!
(Then it was a El Chupacubra)

Velma Dinkley: Jinkies! El Chupacubra!
Alejo Otero: Run!
(They run off as the monster goes after them)

(At the city, the gang stopped on the street as they are tried)

Alejo Otero: I think we lost it.
Daphne Blake: Oh no! The Mystery Machine!
Fred Jones: It's gone!
Velma Dinkley: But crate fluoid it isn't. Someone must have tampered with the brakes on the Mystery machine.
(Then they hear a growl)

Fred Jones: We've got to find Shaggy and Scooby, and the others.
Velma Dinkley: Shaggy!
Daphne Blake: Scooby-Doo, where are you!?
(The Chupacabra shows up again and chases them again as the song "Sol - Kinky plays")

(The go to the entrance of the movie theater, until the El Chupacabra has them cornered, until Shaggy arrives with an unstoppable Mystery Machine, and the gang gets on the van)

(Outside the city, the van goes faster)

Velma Dinkley: Jinkies, perfect timing. If you and the others haven't show up when you did, we be Mexican history.
Daphne Blake: Yeah but, now that we're save from that creepy Bigfoot, you might want to slow down a little.
Shaggy Rogers: I love to slow down, but I have some bad news for ya.
Fred Jones: What's that?
Shaggy Rogers: Like I can't! The brake's to the break.
(The gang panicked and goes down)

Shaggy Rogers: But like, I got some good news too.
Alejo Otero: Yes?
Shaggy Rogers: We're out of gas.
(Then, the Mystery Machine slows down and stops at the gas station)

Daphne Blake: Right in front of a gas station. What are the chances of that?
Luis Otero: Must be the good luck from my Charlene's medallion.
(Fred has filled the tank up with gas)

Fred Jones: Well, gang, all set.
(They got out of the store with supplies, and Alejo comes out with ice for Luis)

Alejo Otero: Here, Luis. I got you some ice for that blow to your head. It must be pretty swollen by now.
Daphne Blake: What happened?
Alejo Otero: I am afraid my brother was attacked by El Chupacabra and received quite a hit on the head. It knocked him, how do you say, "out cold."
Daphne Blake: Here, let me help. Where's the bump? I don't see anything.
Luis Otero: Right here. I can manage. Thank you, Daphne.
(The heroes are now on the van)

Fred Jones: Where to now, guys?
Velma Dinkley: Look! What better place than a museum to learn about the past?
Fred Jones: Visit the museum of anthropology.
Fred Jones: Perfect! And we should be able to get there by morning.
(They go to where the museum is until someone takes out the sign)

Scene 7
(The Mystery Machine continues on the road as we cut to the next morning)

Shaggy Rogers: (yawns) Is it morning already? I could sure use more sleep.\
Luis Otero: I could sure use some of Charlene's coffee.
Scooby-Doo: Reah! Roffee!
Daphne Blake: Guys, look!
(They see a billboard)

Alejo Otero: "Coming soon to Veracruz. Mister Smiley's Latin Adventure"!
Daphne Blake: Looks like the one we have back home.
Shaggy Rogers: Only this one's got a Spanish accent!
Luis Otero: If we don't solve the Chupacabra mystery, the only tourist attraction I foresee is one big empty ghost town.
(The heroes arrived in the museum)

Fred Jones: The curandero said to look to the past. So we might as well start at the very beginning.
Velma DInkley: Interesting. Half-man, half-beast.
Shaggy Rogers: Look, guys! Like, ancient scooters!
Daphne Blake: Leave it to Shaggy to come to a museum and immediately find the toys.
(They ride the scooters down through the museum, and Scooby sees the eyes move out of the statue, and he get scared and runs off. Then they come to a complete stop.)

Velma DInkley: Jinkies! This place is creepy!
Museum guide: Good morning! Are we enjoying ourselves in Mexico City's national museum? Super! And would we like a private tour of the museum which begins with a special live, multimedia show about the Aztecs? Super! Please follow the green directional arrows on the floor to the special VIP Auditorium.
(They made it to the VIP Auditorium)

Museum guide: Please watch your step.
(They go down and they each take a seat)

Museum guide: Continue down front and be seated in the comfy chairs made of rich Corinthian leather. Okay, super! Let's turn back the hands of time, shall we?
(She spins the clock as it stops to 1325 ad the show begins as fog effect appears, then we see a fake panther and eagle. Then a golden serpent resembles of a dragon came down out of nowhere roars at Scooby as he hides under the seats)

Museum guide: The war-like Aztecs had many barbarous rituals. For example, warriors sacrificed thousands of captives on the altars atop the pyramids often ripping out their still-beating hearts to offer to the gods. Super. And now I'd like a volunteer from the audience.
(Shaggy hides under the seats with Scooby)

Museum guide: How about you?
Daphne Blake: Freddy?
(The museum guide takes Daphne away as the Aztec natives place the cover on Daphne as they move their spears and then museum guide snaps her finger and the natives and the museum guide disappeared along with Daphne)

Fred Jones: Daphne!
Velma Dinkley: She's gone!
Museum guide (voice): You've been warned! Please follow the arrows to the clearly marked exit doors to your right. Super!
Shaggy Rogers: Excellent idea! Just like what we had in mind: Exiting. - Right, Scoob?
Scooby-Doo: Reah! Rexiting!
(They walk away)

Fred Jones: Hey! Not so fast, you two!
Velma Dinkley: (carries Shaggy and Scooby back) We can't leave here until we find Daphne.
Alejo Otero: And her kidnappers.
Fred Jones: Where could they have gone?
Luis Otero: Why would someone want to kidnap Daphne?
Velma Dinkley: Look at this. It looks like some sort of ripped label from one of the warriors' costumes. "Mile Enter" I wonder what that means.
Fred Jones: Let me see that.
Velma Dinkley: Look! A trap door!
Alejio Otero: I wonder where it leads to?
Fred Jones: My guess is that it will take us right to Daphne and her kidnappers. It sure looks like the perfect getaway.
Shaggy Rogers: Speaking of getting away.
(They try to back away, but they are stopped by Velma, and they go back)

Fred Jones: Come on, guys. There's no turning back now.
Shaggy Rogers: Great, a dark spooky tunnel. I hate dark spooky tunnels!
(The heroes climbs down stairs, one of the stairs not strong enough causes Shaggy trip and accidentally grabs on to the Quetzalcoatl statue and activates the trap. The stairs becomes slides as the heroes slides down like a roller coaster)

Scooby-Doo: Wee!
(They about to go the end of the slide, but Scooby manages to back a way for them the get throught and Velma pulls him back. Then they go to the stone fists trying to crush them, but they dodged every smashing attack)

Shaggy Rogers: Phew.
(They slide down and they come across a statue that tried to eat them, but they stopped and they run off and the head spits out fire that chased them and collapsed the pathway, and Shaggy grabs the edge, and the rest of the gang swings to other side, where they climb up, stepping on Shaggy's head everytime)

Shaggy Rogers: Ow.
(Fred came up and then helps Shaggy up)

Velma Dinkley: Look, here's a door.
(Scooby get scared. Then, Velma pushes the door open, as they got out)

Alejo Otero: We must be at the pyramids.
Velma Dinkley: I've read about these. The pyramids were created by the Olmec Indians who built Mesoamerica's first great civilization.
Fred Jones: It's the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent, the good god we saw a statue of at the curandero's tent.
Velma Dinkley: Look! At the top! It's Daphne!
Daphne Blake: Where am I?
Fred Jones: Daphne, don't move! We'll be right there!
(They run up the pyramid, until they got tired)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, if the Aztecs were so brilliant... why didn't they invent an elevator?
Scooby-Doo: Reah, relevator!
Daphne Blake: Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Velma Dinkley: What happened to you?
Daphne Blake: I'm not sure. I was blindfolded the whole time by that fake museum guide and her warrior friends.
Fred Jones: Let's get out of here, before they come back for you.
Scene 8
(Later the gang sees a sacred idol)

Velma Dinkley: That's odd, that statue wasn't here before.
(Then the statue breaks down)

Daphne Blake: What's going on?
(The group sees a no good scared idol which breaks and the gang are suddenly trapped in a cage then an eagle flies on top of the cage)

Paco: Hello, mi amigos, I am Paco, the magical talking eagle. I protect the pyramids here at the place of the gods.
Alejo Otero: (covers his ears) That's the worst Spanish accent I've ever heard.
Fred Jones: I know, he looks more like a character from a tacky theme park.
Paco: These evil tourists have destroyed a sacred idol and angered the gods!
Alejo Otero: We did no such thing! (to the tourists) This eagle is lying to you!
Paco: Do not believe their lies! When the cage lifts, you must run them out of here before they completely ruin the ruins! If you don't, the gods will seek revenge themselves, and ay carumba, mi amigos, you don't want to see that!
(Paco flies off and the angry tourists came toward the the gang and Shaggy and Scooby scream as the heroes run for their lives)

(They ran down the pyramids as the tourists chase them, too, and around a corner as Scooby was about fall down but ran around the corner and continued running until they see a hole at the pyramids as Daphne grabs Scooby's tail)

Daphne Blake: Quick! In here!
(And then they hid inside as tourists pass them)

Daphne Blake: Ew! There's a bunch of spiders down here!
Shaggy and Scooby: SPIDERS?!
(They go on Velma as she hold them in her arms)

Velma Dinkley: No, guys, Actually, they are scopions.
Shaggy Rogers: Oh, gee thanks. I feel much better, now.
Alejo Otero: Don't worry about the scorpions, I'm sure the rats will kill them.
(The group ran as the rats chase after them)

Scooby-Doo: Rats!
(They run from the rats to a door and closes it to keep the rats from coming in)

Velma Dinkley: Jinkies. We must be in the ancient tombs.
(Then Shaggy got close to the skeletons, backwards, and the skeletons hand touched him, which scares him, causing him to hide in the jar)

Fred Jones: Don't worry, Shaggy. Everything in here is dead.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, how comforting.
Velma Dinkley: Look. We can disguise ourselves by wearing the traditional clothing of the native Indian skeletons!
(Later the group dressed up as the Dead Aztec people)

Daphne Blake: Just act natural.
(The group tries to walk by, when suddenly...)

Tourist: Look! It's the vandals trying to disguise themselves by wearing the traditional clothing of the native Indian skeletons!
(They ran as fast as they can with the tourists chasing them again. They see another hole to hide and hid there as the door closes and the tourists pass through)

(They are now in the other pyramids with different artifacts)

(The background music plays with "A Donde Vas" by Carolina Lao. As the dragon comes to life, and flap its wings to blow Shaggy, Scooby, Tara, Inuyasha, and Jeri are blown into a tree, and Daphne, Velma, and Rika into a creature that came to life, then Fred, Tino, Takato landed where the jaguars come to life)

(Later, Paco is seen flying and sees the dragon, screams, and plummets to a tree, where Shaggy, Scooby, Tara, Inuyasha, and Jeri were, and the dragon flew around the pyramids and buzzcuts the trees' leaves. Shaggy, Scooby, Inuyasha, Tara Duncan and Jeri glare at the bird and Scooby growls at it)

(They attack Paco on top the tree. Then we got to Alejo and Luis stops and then sees a statue comes to life and tries to stomp on them, and then chases them into a building. The creature is still flying in the air as Daphne, Velma, and Rika are still hanging on. And we cut to Fred, ,Tino, and Takato, surrounded by jaguars)

(But the jaguars are brushing their head on their legs, and they licked their faces, then they are disturbed by Paco, who fell from the tree. Then they pounced on Paco beating him up)

Paco: Help!
(They continue to beat up Paco, and the statue is still trying to get Alejo and Luis, until the flying beast is flying over him, as the statue tries to shoo it away, but it lands on his and he hit himself on the head and then he broke into pieces, as Fuente shows until the Mystery Machine takes Alejo and Luis away)

Alejo Otero: Señor Fuente? What's he doing here?
Fred Jones: Trying to attack you.
(Then Shaggy, Scooby, Tara, Jeri, and Inuyasha are waving their arms to get them out of the tree. And Daphne guide the monster to the tree, and Shaggy, Scooby, Tara, Jeri, and Inuyasha grabbed the tail, until the serpent gets stuck on the gate way, and they jump off and on top of the Mystery Machine)

(Later, Paco, still broken, plummets down as the gang watches him sternly)

Velma Dinkley: Magical eagle. Huh. I didn't buy this animatronic impostor for one minute.
Daphne Blake: I guess the Corrindo was right, things in Mexico aren't always as they seem.
Fred Jones: Come on, guys. We better get of here, before these mysterious mischievous makers try to taught themselves.
Scene 9
(Later, a torch is lighting a candle where it's at a cemetery, where all people were gathering some gifts and flowers for their ancestors then The gang, Alejo, and Luis enter the cemetery, then El Chupacabra was hiding behind the bushes, Shaggy and Scooby smile nervously and ran as fast they could then Scooby stops and sees Chiquita and ignores her by acting like a man while Chiquita sees him affectionately, However, Scooby hits a gravestone)

Scooby-Doo: Rouch!
Chiquita: (giggles)
(Later, we Sofia, Doña Dolores, and three woman with Dolores sitting on a bench with Sofia looking upset)

Old Woman #1: How awful to witness something like that.
Old Woman #2: You are so strong, Dolores. Like a bull.
Old Woman #3: Some people have all the luck. Why can't the Chupacabra carry off my future daughter-in-law?
Doña Dolores: (sternly) Señora!
(The woman shrugged)

Alejo Otero: What's going on? (Alejo, Luis, and the gang arrived to see Doña Dolores and Sofia) Are you alright?
Luis Otero: Where's Charlene? Charlene!
Doña Dolores: Please, please. Calm down, both of you. There's nothing to be upset about. EL CHUPACABRA HAS RUN OFF WITH YOUR FIANCÉE! We'll never see her again! (Sobbing)
Alejo Otero: Please, tell us what happened?
Sofia Otero: It all started just as moments after you left. We were in the cafe, your mother Charlene and I. El Chupacabra broke down the door, picked up Charlene in his arms and run off with her!
Luis Otero: Charlene! This is bad. I shouldn't have left!
Velma Dinkley: Jinkies! And she is still missing.
Sofia Otero: Yes, we been looking for her since yesterday. The villagers are continuing the search; here at the cemetery and up in the hills.
Jorge Otero: Grr. I'm El Chupacabra, I'm gonna to eat you.
(He chases the two kids as they scream)

Sofia Otero: All this talk of the Chupacabra is not good for the children. (The kids run to Sofia) Now forget all about this scary monster nonsense, and play with your skeleton among the tombstone. (They leave and cut to Luis and Alejo)
Luis Otero: I must go and join the search!
(He marches but Fred stopped him)

Fred Jones: Yes, but'll be more productive if we first get all our facts straight.
(Later outside the cemetery)

Fred Jones: I think the village is being terrorized for a reason. Somebody wants him to scare everyone off and get us out of the way.
Daphne Blake: But what's to be gained from that?
Velma Dinkley: El Chupacabra is scaring off the tourists, making businesses suffer.
Fred Jones: If the Oteros are forced to sale. Señor Fuente gets what he wants, the Otero's land.
Daphne Blake: Good point. But what does that have to do with El Chupacabra?
Fred Jones: The footprints leading away from the cottage, suggested El Chupacabra was scared off when Shaggy alerted the rest of us.
Shaggy Rogers: Ha! Some monster. He was okay scaring Scoob and me, but chicken out when there are more of us.
Scooby: Reah.
Velma Dinkley: Maybe he's a fake.
Daphne Blake: I don't we can roll out the supernatural.
Alejo and Luis: Supernatural?
Daphne Blake: If the creatures at the pyramids were special affects. They were pretty special.
Shaggy Rogers: And very effective.
Velma Dinkley: Real or fake, somebody's been following us.
Fred Jones: Yeah, they're anticipating our every move. But how?
Velma Dinkley: Let's look at me video tape again.
(They look at the video they took earlier.)

Fred Jones: Wait, freeze that frame. Look, whoever wrote "mañana," a Spanish word for "tomorrow" forgot the tilde.
Shaggy Rogers: What's a tilde?
Fred Jones: Its a symbol you put over the "n" to change the pronunciation. Without it the word would be said as "manana" instead of "mañana," a mistake no real Spanish speaking person would ever make.
Velma Dinkley: Looks like your Spanish lessons are finally paid off.
Fred Jones: Oh uh, Muchas Gracias.
Shaggy Rogers: So the bad guy doesn't speak Spanish?
Fred Jones: Maybe, but there's always the possibility there's more than one bad guy.
Daphne Blake: Velma, did you save the torn label from the fake warrior's costume?
Velma Dinkley: Sure did, but I still don't know what it means.
Doña Dolores: Sorry to interupt. But it's time to pay our respects. We're already to go.
Sofia Otero: Please, feel free to join us.
(They go with them to start the Day of the Dead, as Luis is at his father's grave)

Luis Otero: My homemade mango salsa, your favorite. And from Charlene, a cup of her cafe lechera. Maybe if he knows where she is, he will send us a sign.
(Suddenly, gray smoke came out of Señor Otero's grave and it appears to turn in a ghost, revealing of an old man which scares everybody)

Ghost of Señor Otero: I am the Ghost of Senor Otero. And don't be alarmed. As you all know today we spirits return to Earth to comune with the living.
(Dolores was shocked and fainted but was captured by Sofia as Alejo grabbed her hand)

Alejo Otero: Mama, please wake up!
(Dolores wakes up)

Ghost of Señor Otero: I have learned that an El Chupacabra, is a result of an evil curse. Pleased upon our land. The only way to break the spell is to get rid of that land. Once the land is sold, El Chupacabra will vanish forever! And Charlene will be returned unharmed.
Luis Otero: Charlene?
(To Alejo with the people)

Alejo Otero: That doesn't look or sound like anything like my father. Someone is playing a trick on us.
(Everyone gasps)

Fred Jones: Can I see your medallion. (takes a look a the back) Just as I thought. It's a tracking device. Let's see if it works in reverse. (presses the button)
(Then, Scooby, and Chiquita hear a sound)

(They follow to where the noise is coming from, and then they see the where the noise is coming from, and discovered that the skeleton is controling a holographic ghost)

(Then Scooby and Chiquta barks at him)

Skeleton: Now stop that now! Now be quiet! You hear me?! QUIET!
(They continue to bark, as we cut to the people)

Ghost of Señor Otero: Please, ignore the stupid dogs.
(They go the building, where the skeleton was)

Skeleton: Pay no attention to the man, behind the curtin.
Ghost of Señor Otero: Leave the cemetery at once! It's cursed! The whole town is cursed! Sell the land and everything will return to normal.
Fred Jones: (laughs) Can't you see? Many of them don't understand your foreign language. Speaking Spanish might help.
Skeleton: Well, I don't know how to speak Spanish. Why can't everyone just learn English.
(He closes the curtain and Fred walks towards the curtain and opens it but the skeleton man crawls away but Scooby stops him)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, not so fast, señor.
(Daphne unmasks the skeleton as Mr. Smiley)

Fred Jones: It's Mr. Smiley!
(The officers come)

Daphne Blake: Officers.
(The officers put Mr. Smiley in handcuffs)

Velma Dinkley: We suspected that "Mile" and "Enter" are part of bigger words. And look we were right. "Smiley Entertainment." When Mister Smiley was unable to convince the locals to sell their land for his new theme park, he turned to the Otero family.
Fred Jones: Their hotel is built on some of the best real estate in Veracruz. When they refused to sell, well, he wouldn't take "no" for an answer.
Daphne Blake: So he terrorize the tourists with the Chupachapra attacks, hoping to ruin the Otero's hotel business and force them to sell.
Velma Dinkley: And then, he did everything he could to prevent us from revealing his scheme.
Fred Jones: Smiley was the only person to pull it off.
Luis Otero: But why?
Mr. Smiley: Oh please, you're only encouraging him.
Fred Jones: Being the head of a theme park, he had access to the best special effects money can buy.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, not to mention the animatronic animals like our magical eagle friend, Paco.
(He shows the broken Paco)

Daphne Blake: And by kidnapping me and framing us as vandals, he was able to derail our investigation and create bad publicity for the pyramids.
Velma Dinkley: Seen to be his chief competitor for the dollars of tourists all over the world.
Scene 10
Shaggy Rogers: Our deductions makes perfect sense. But if Smiley is behind the Chupacabra attacks, then how do we explain that?!
(They see El Chupacabra on top of the building and roars later the people, the gang, Tino and his friends were scared)

Daphne Blake: It sure doesn't look like a special effect to me.
Sofia Otero: It is the monster!
Luis Otero: El Chupacabra!
(Shaggy and Scooby gulped)

Shaggy Rogers: This is gonna be bad, real bad.
(El Chupacabra jumps down to the roof of the building as he roars and scare everyone, he then throws a chimney when the people run for their lives, and El Chupacabra jumps off the building to the ground and then he throws a table with food at the gang)

(They did took cover with a table as the sauce splatted the table)

Fred Jones: You don't scare us, you big Bigfoot wanna-be!
(The song "Mueve Mi Sangre" plays as El Chupracabra chases everyone in until it is captured)

Jorge Otero: They caught the monster!
Fred Jones: We caught something but... (unzipped the Chupacabra costume, revealing to be the tour guide) "Monster" is just a bit strong.
Museum guide: Well, we weren't expecting that. (Her stilts come up of nowhere) Were we?
(Everyone are surprised, and the police goes to arrest her)

Mr Smiley: Oh please, leave her alone. She only did what I'd asked her to do, so I'm the guilty one not her.
Daphne Blake: Hardly, it takes two to tango.
Museum guide: I'm afraid she's right. Smiley didn't have to pull my leg to be part of his scheme. I love him.
Scooby-Doo: Aw.
Museum guide: You see, I worked as an actress and stuntwoman at his theme park.
Mr. Smiley: When I visited one day, it was love at first sight.
Scene 11
Luis Otero: Speaking of love, where is my fiancee, Charlene?
Museum guide: I'm afraid you won't be seeing her ever again. Pick up the pieces of your shattered life and find someone new.
Luis Otero: I can't accept that! Papa, I asked for a sign, Papa. Anything to show us where Charlene might be. Please don't let your firstborn son down.
Sofia Otero: (in a distance) Look! The gifts we left for him are gone!
Alejo Otero: The only thing that is left is the cafe lechera that Charlene made for him.
Luis Otero: I don't understand.
Velma Dinkley: I'm beginning to.
Museum guide: (drops some coffee beens) I was afraid of that.
Velma Dinkley: Hmm. I seem to recall someone mention coffee grinds. Coming out of their ears from working at the café all day.
(Velma removes the mask of the museum guide which reveals to be Charlene and Luis and his family gasp)

Henry Wong: Charlene! I've should have known!
Luis Otero: Charlene! Charlene, I thought you'd love me.
Charlene: Oh, would you wake up and smell the café lechera, you peabrain romantic?! I never loved you! I loved your money! I mean, if we got married, your inheritance would become mine. And then I would fixing to drop you like a hot tamale and share my riches with my honey bunch here. (She kisses Smiley)
Mr. Smiley: But that iddy biddy brother of your have to complicate everything. Mr. "I wanna respect father's wishes over there".
Diego Fuente: (voice in the distance) Oh thank goodness you're all okay.
(Diego enters as Scooby and Shaggy hide behind Chiquita)

Luis Otero: You mean you-you knew about all of this?
Diego Fuente: Please, let me explain. I admit I tried to convince you to sell your land. But I finally accepted that you would never go against your father's wishes, and I respected that. But these two characters don't understand things like loyalty and family. When I heard of their harebrained Bigfoot scheme, I tried to track you down at the pyramids. Not to harm you, but to warn you.
Alejo Otero: I understand. Please, accept my apologies.
Fred Jones: And please accept our apologies, Luis. I have to admit, there were times when we questioned your integrity. We were wrong.
Luis Otero: I can see how misunderstandings happen. From now on, I will try to look beyond the surface to what lies beneath.
Charlene: Well, what happens now, hon?
Mr. Smiley: We go to jail! What do you think happens? We could've made billions if it hadn't been for those meddling kids!
(The heroes laughed as the two villains were hauled away by the police.)

Doña Dolores: I never trusted Señorita Charlene, that bruja!
Shaggy Rogers: Bruja?
Fred Jones: That means, "witch."
(With Luis and Alejo)

Luis Otero: Alejo, I have something to confess.
Alejo Otero: Yes, brother.
Luis Otero: Hermano, when you called out for help, I did hear you, but I was paralyzed with fear. After loosing papa last year, I panicked at the thought of loosing my only brother, so I'd lied and said the Bigfoot knocked me out. I'm sorry for being a coward, Alejo. I pray it never happens again.
Alejo Otero: Luis. There are worse things than becoming a coward.
(Shaggy hops in and grabs both of them)

Shaggy Rogers: Yeah like I made a career out of it.
(Later the gang sit on a picnic blanket)

Daphne Blake: So guess there never was a real Chupacabra. I wonder how that myth got started.
Velma Dinkley: Like all myths, I guess. Since the beginning of time, men and women have loved to tell stories. And what better reason for creating them than to explain the many things we don't understand and maybe never will?
Shaggy Rogers: Like how they can pack so much flavor into one piece of fruit?
(Dolores grabs Shaggy’s hand and waves her finger and takes him)

Hay Lin: Come on everyone, it's time to dance!
(Everyone begins to dance in celebration of the Day of the Dead)

Scooby-Doo: Scooby-Dooby-Doo! (Laughs) Adios!
(Chiquita shakes the maracas as the movie ends)
