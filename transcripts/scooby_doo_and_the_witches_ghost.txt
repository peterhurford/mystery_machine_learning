(The movie opens as the credits roll outside. Inside the museum, a dean walks out of his office and locks the door and then walks out of the museum for the night. Throughout the museum, Velma, Daphne, Fred, Shaggy, and Scooby Doo stand still as different museum exhibits. Then, a pair of tombs open.)

Dr. Dean: Is anyone there? (He backs away as he accidentally press the button which causes the lights to go on as the speaker speaks, scaring him and causing him to drop his paperwork.) I really must switch to decaf.
(Two warrior monsters with their weapons appear out of the tomb, preparing to attack the dean.)

Shaggy Rogers: Professor... behind you.
(The two monsters attack, as they look at Shaggy and Scooby.)

Shaggy Rogers: Like... stay right there!
(Scooby throws the saber-tooth tiger skin on one of the monsters, until it rips out of the skin.)

Scooby-Doo: Raggy!
Shaggy Rogers: Now, Scoob!
(Scooby grabs the rope and releases the net, trapping the two monsters.)

Shaggy Rogers: The trap worked, Scoob!
Scooby-Doo: Reah! (Laughs)
Shaggy Rogers: Give me four!
(One of the monsters uses an axe to break free.)

Shaggy Rogers: You're the man, Scoob.
Scooby-Doo: You're the man!
(The two monsters poke their fingers on Shaggy and Scooby)

Shaggy and Scooby: Yikes!
(The monsters chase after them as the Scooby-Doo theme song plays. Then suddenly, a foot appears behind a curtain and trips the monsters onto the floor.)

Fred Jones: Nice going, guys! You caught them.
Shaggy Rogers: Uh... right. No problem, Freddy. Like we had a little help.
(A man shows up.)

Daphne Blake: Who are you?
Velma Dinkley: (gasps in amazement) I don't believe it! You're Ben Ravencroft, the famous horror writter!
Ben Ravencroft: That's right. And let's see who they are.
(Ben takes off one of the monsters' mask, which is revealed to be a person.)

Dr. Dean: (gasps) It's Perkins!
Velma Dinkley: (takes off a mask which reveals to be another person.) And Griswald! Disgruntled archaeologists from the museum's Babylonian project. They were upset with you for cutting their funding, Dr. Dean.
Perkins: And we would've gotten away with it too. If it wasn't for this... meddling writter!
(The police arrest them.)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, that's a twist.
Fred Jones: At least, he didn't call us kids. I hate that.
Daphne Blake: Guess you beat us to the punch, Mr. Ravencroft.
Ben Ravencroft: Sorry, I didn't mean to abstain you. I was doing research on my latest novel when I saw these archaeologists acting suspiciously and decided to investigate.
Velma Dinkley: Mr. Ravencroft, I am a huge fan of your work. I have read all your books in which my opinion are the best horror stories ever written.
Ben Ravencroft: Thanks, Velma.
Velma Dinkley: (gasps in amazed) You know my name?
Ben Ravencroft: And Daphne's and Fred's. (Chuckles) And Scooby and Shaggy's of course.
Scooby-Doo: (Giggling)
Ben Ravencroft: I've admired your work on revealing the supernatural mysteries for some time now. I mean, basically we're in the same business of mystery and the acult, right?
Velma Dinkley: Oh please, what we do pales in comparation with the sheer ponderable fright of your novels.
Ben Ravencroft: I wouldn't say that.
Velma Dinkley: I mean, take the dead mole for example; oh, that creepy jewerly store owner was an incredibly complex character.
Ben Ravencroft: You're very kind. Listen Velma, I'm going back to my hometown in Massachusetts this weekend to the house, where I work my early book. I go back every year for the fall color. It's very peaceful and relaxing. Why don't you and your friends come visit?
Velma Dinkley: (gasps) Really? Oh, that would be great! Uh, wouldn't it gang?
Daphne Blake: Yeah. We can use a break from all these spooky mysteries.
Ben Ravencroft: And Oakhaven does have one of the best restaurants in New England.
Shaggy Rogers: Like we're sold! Eh, Scoob?
Scooby-Doo: Yeah.
(Now, we cut to the gang driving in the Mystery Machine, Velma is in Ben's car while he's driving as then they made to Oakhaven.)

Daphne Blake: Wow! This color is spectacular, eh, guys?
Fred Jones: Amazing.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah.
Shaggy Rogers: Don't forget me old buddy.
(Scooby takes a picture of him and Shaggy as they drive across a bridge. We fade to Velma and Ben, in Ben's car.)

Velma Dinkley: And that scene at the end where the caretaker's flesh dissolved was so brilliant I-
Ben Ravencroft: Oh look, we're here.
Velma Dinkley: Already?
(Then they make a left turn, and they make it to Oakhaven.)

Ben Ravencroft: Welcome to Oakhaven. (sees something) What?
(A traffic jam is seen ahead.)

Velma Dinkley: I thought you said this was a quiet little town.
Ben Ravencroft: It was.
Fred Jones: Wow, this is a pretty popular spot.
(They get out of their cars.)

Daphne Blake: Do many people come here often?
Ben Ravencroft: Sure we always get a few leaf peepers but never like this. This is a "circus." (sees a man) Oh, there's the mayor, he'll know what's going on.
(They go to him)

Shaggy: Like, maybe he'll know a place to eat.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah.
(They go to him, too)

Mayor Corey: Welcome to old Oakhaven. Have a wonderful time. So glad you can come.
Ben Ravencroft: Mayor! Mayor Corey!
Mayor Corey: Ben, my boy! I'm glad you can come home to see this. And I see you brought some friends and their dog.
Scooby-Doo: Dog? Where?
Mayor Corey: Welcome! The more the merrier!
Ben Ravencroft: But what is all this?
Mayor Corey: It's great, isn't it? Business is booming, not like a few months ago when it was slower than maple syrup on a cold day.
Man: Hey, Ben.
Ben Ravencroft: Hi, Mr. McKnight.
Mr. McKnight: Welcome home. Here, have a T-shirt before my store sells out. You can wear it to the concert, tomorrow.
Ben Ravencroft: Concert?
Fred Jones: The Hex Girls.
Daphne Blake: You've heard of them, Fred?
Fred Jones: Just now.
Mayor Corey: A local group. You'll like them, kindda spooky.
Ben Ravencroft: (seeing a T-shirt) "I met the ghost of Oakhaven and lived"
Shaggy and Scooby: Ghost?!
Velma Dinkley: Jinkies! Looks like you got a ghost in your own backyard, Ben.
Mayor Corey: Not only that. (whispering) But it's his own ancestor, the ghost of Sarah Ravencroft.
Ben Ravencroft: That's ridiculous. I thought we'd got past over this "witch" nonsence.
Mayor Corey: What can I say, Ben. Ever since, we built our puritan villiage, her ghost has appeared many times.
Fred Jones: Don't tell me, you disturbed her spirit with the construction?
Daphne Blake: And now, she's haunting the town.
Ben Ravencroft: Did you say "puritan village?"
(Now we go to the Puritan Village)

Mayor Corey: What you're seeing is a perfect recreation of life was like back in the 1600's, as renunacted by our locals.
Ben Ravencroft: When did all of this go on?
Mayor Corey: About six months ago.
Velma Dinkley: This is amazing, Mayor.
(They see the little dolls)

Daphne Blake: Oh, cornhouse dolls. Aren't they cute, Fred?
Fred Jones: Yeah, charming.
(We go to Shaggy showing Scooby that he's in a pillory)

(Then, Shaggy and Scooby go to a woman using a churn.)

Pilgrim Woman: Which thou like to churn?
Scooby-Doo: Huh?
Shaggy Rogers: Like it's your turn to churn the butter, old buddy.
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh.
(Scooby churns it, then uses it as a guitar, and he slipped and everyone laughed.)

Shaggy Rogers: Now, all we need is the popcorn.
(With Velma, Ben, and the Mayor)

Velma Dinkley: So you say a ghost has been appearing here?
Mayor Corey: Ah-yup. That's right, young lady. Apparently, we disturb the spirit of Ben's ancestor, who was persecuted as a witch. Way back in 1657.
Ben Ravencroft: Unjustifiably persecuted. Sarah Ravencroft was a medicine woman who practiced natural healing, and was unfairly accused because of her asencted ways!
Velma Dinkley: Just like the Salem witch trials. Many men and women who were a bit different or didn't conform to the codes of the colony, suffer the same fate.
Ben Ravencroft: Sarah was a healer. It was said she even kept a journal of all thepatients she cured with her orble riminies.
(Shaggy and Scooby goes to the dolls, and Scooby grabs a tiny hat)

Scooby-Doo: Look, Shaggy. (Buts on the tiny hat)
Shaggy Rogers: It a perfect fit, Scoob.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah.
(Then the hat blows away and then the mole, takes it, as Scooby looks at him, he goes down to his hole, Scooby tries to get the hat back, but the mole bit Scooby's paw)

Scooby-Doo: Ow! (growls)

(He digs through the dirt)

Shaggy Rogers: Easy Scoob.
(Then Scooby found a item he got out of the hole)

Shaggy Rogers: Like what you got there old buddy?
Scooby-Doo: (spits the item out) I don't know.
Shaggy Rogers: Wonder what this is?
Mayor Corey: Looks like you found a old shoe buckle, my boy. Probably over 400 years old.
Shaggy Rogers: Cool. (attaches the shoe buckle into his shoe) Man. Like for another one, Scoob. So I can have a matching pair
Scooby-Doo: Okay.
Mayor Corey: A yeah, we found all sorts of items from the old colony when we cleared this area for construction. Handmade nails, horseshoes, farm equipment.
Ben Ravencroft: How about a book?
Mayor Corey: A book?
Ben Ravencroft: You know how long I've been searching for Sarah's journal. To offically clear our family name.
Mayor Corey: Sorry, Ben. Nothing like that.
Fred Jones: What makes you think that it's Sarah's ghost haunts this place?
Mayor Corey: Because the ghost says so. Maybe you'll see her tonight.
Fred Jones: Oh boy.
(Then, Shaggy's stomach growls)

Shaggy Rogers: Hey, we like to see a puritan pizza joint. We're starved.
Scooby-Doo: Reah.
Mayor Corey: Don't worry, boys, we got the best restaurant in all New England. It's back in town, I'll walk you there.
Ben Ravencroft: Do you kids wanna go, or do you want to see my studio?
Velma Dinkley: Wow, would we ever! Shaggy, we'll meet up with you later!
Ben Ravencroft: Mayor! Tell Jack that anything they order is on me.
Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! Like what a great guy.
Scooby-Doo: Reah, reat!
Daphne Blake: (laughs) You're gonna regret that offer, Ben.
(At a place called "Oakhaven Restaurant," Shaggy and Scooby smell the food.)

Mayor Corey: Jack's gonna take care of you, boys. You're gonna love his cooking.
Shaggy Rogers: We sure will, your honor.
Mayor Corey: Enjoy your stay at Oakhaven.
Shaggy Rogers: Thanks your dudeness.
(A man is eating his lunch when Scooby appears from behind, looking at his food. Jack walks to Shaggy and Scooby.)

Jack: Well, boys, are you hungry?
Shaggy Rogers: Man, are we ever.
Jack: Come over here to the back, I've always have a table for V.I.P's.
Shaggy Rogers: Groovy. Come on Scoob.
(He takes Scooby along, as they got into a table)

Jack: You're Mr. Ravencroft's guests so order up anything on the menu, fellas. I've got a nice juicy ham bone for your dog. What do ya think?
Scooby-Doo: Rone?! Yuck!
Shaggy Rogers: Scooby's allergic to bones. We'll have whatever that great smell is.
Jack: Well, that's our Yankee pot roast, New England clam chowder, maple baked ham and beans, Roast turkey with chestnut stuff, and apple cinnamon pie.
(They get excited)

Shaggy Rogers: Sounds great! Like give us 2 orders of everything.
Jack: (laughs) Oh, I love people who love to eat.
(They prepare to eat everything that Jack brings.)

(At Ben's house)

Velma Dinkley: Wow so this is where it all started
Ben Ravencroft: Yes. I wrote all my early novels here. Now I spend must of my time in Europe, but I come back once a year to recharge my batteries. Go ahead, Velma, sit down.
Velma Dinkley: Jinkies, this is a dream come true.
Daphne Blake: You have some cool things here Ben.
Fred Jones: I'll say. So, who's protrait is this?
Ben Ravencroft: This is Sarah Ravencroft. I think it was painted by a greatful patient.
(Flashback starts)

Ben Ravencroft: (V.O.) Of course, she wasn't very popular with the town's doctors. Sarah was untraditional in her approach to medicine. She was a wiccan.
Fred Jones: (V.O.) Say what?
Velma Dinkley: (V.O.) I'd reed about them. Wiccans were people who were in turned with the forces of nature and use them for healing purposes.
Ben Ravencroft: (V.O.) Exactly, she believed in using herbs and other natural elements to draw from the Earth's power to heal the sick. Sarah helped many people who cannot afford medical treatment. She treated her patients under a large oak tree, which she believed to have healing powers.
(Flashback ends)

Velma Dinkley: Hey, I saw a huge oak tree like that in the town square.
Ben Ravencroft: I've already search the area around that tree, but never found anything. That book can finally proof that Sarah's innocents and that she was a wiccan not an evil witch.
Velma Dinkley: Wiccans have been misunderstood accused of sorcery. In fact the word "witch" comes from "Wicca."
Ben Ravencroft: I'm impressed, Velma. You know doing research on Sarah and the wiccans, lead me to read almost everything about the world of supersation. That's how I started writing stories to frighten people.
(A woman gasps in horror, as the people in the restaurant are looking at Scooby and Shaggy eating like a pack of wolves, as Jack returns, bringing them more food.)

Jack: (laughs nervously) I never seen anything like this. Are you at least tasting my food?
(They nod and swallow the food in their stuffed mouths)

Shaggy Rogers: It's the best food we ever had.
Scooby-Doo: Delicious.
(Scooby drinks the tomato soup and then the man runs out of the restaurant in disgust as the gang arrives)

Daphne Blake: So, how's the food?
Shaggy Rogers: Pretty darn good.
Velma Dinkley: Is there anything left in the kitchen?
Jack: I'll be right back, guys. I'm gonna make a run at the market.
Fred Jones: It's getting dark guys. Let's go see if that ghost is gonna make an appearance.
Shaggy Rogers: Like we loved to. But we haven't had our dessert yet.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, yeah.
Daphne Blake: Okay, but after you're finished. Meet us at the puritan village.
Velma Dinkley: Ben's already gone ahead
Shaggy Rogers: Great! Like if the ghost gets there. Just start screaming without us.
(Scooby tries to eat the chicken leg from Shaggy and he dodges Scooby's bite on the chicken)

Shaggy Rogers: Hey!
(At night, we see many people in the puritan village)

Tourist 1: Come on, we've been waiting here an hour. The ghost is a no show.
Tourist 2: Maybe she'll show up in the concert tomorrow.
(Then they all leave except for the gang)

Ben Ravencroft: Too bad. I was going to have a little chat with my ghostly ancestor. I wanted to ask here where she'd hid her journal.
Daphne Blake: Boy, Ben seems to be pretty obsessed with that book.
Fred Jones: I'll say.
Ben Ravencroft: We should all leave too.
Daphne Blake: We should give it a chance, Ben.
Fred Jones: Yeah, it's probably a hokey bedsheet with a wire or something. This could be funny.
(Back to the Oakhaven Restaurant, a stuffed Shaggy and Scooby leave the restaurant with their bellies full)

Shaggy Rogers: Thanks for everything, Jack. It was great. Especially those last 12 pies.
Jack: Uh, glad you like them.
(Jack then sits sitting down with a whole pile of dishes that the two friends ate up)

(To the Shaggy and Scooby)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, was that good eating or what, Scoob?
Scooby-Doo: Yeah. (burps) Excuse me.
Shaggy Rogers: Gee, looks like everybody's leaving. Wonder if the ghost showed up.
(They continue walking)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, with no one here, this place is almost spooky, Scoob. (laughs nervously)
Scooby-Doo: Yeah (laughs nervously) (Then hears footsteps) Shaggy.
(Then they saw three shadows that look like ladies)

Shaggy Rogers: Look girls!
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, girls.
(They make themselves look handsome)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, hi girls.
Girls: Hi.
(They go to there fat self, as they scream and run from the three girls, as they worked off the food they ate)

Shaggy Rogers: I think we lost them, old buddy.
(They stopped for a moment)

Shaggy Rogers: And I thought there was only one ghost witch.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah.
Shaggy Rogers: Anyway, with all that running, we'd worked off that big meal. But you know now I'm hungry again.
Scooby-Doo: Me too.
(Suddenly they hear a wind blowing and then a laugh which is the witch's ghost)

Shaggy and Scooby: Yikes!
(They run for their lives.)

Witch's GhostTHIS TOWN SHALL PAY! FOR WHAT IT DID TO ME!
(The witch's ghost throws fireballs at them, as they keep on running)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, it's every coward for himself, Scoob!
(They turn left, and they then crash into Fred and the others)

Velma Dinkley: What's going on guys?
Scooby-Doo: Rhost!
Ben Ravencroft: A roast? (He helps Velma get up)
Scooby-Doo: A witch's ghost!
Velma Dinkley: You saw the witch's ghost?
Scooby-Doo: Yeah.
(Scooby acts like a witch)

Fred Jones: So where is the ghost? Can you show us?
Shaggy Rogers: Like, do we have to? SHE THROWS FIREBALLS, MAN!!
Daphne Blake: Oh, can you at least get off me first, Freddy?
Fred Jones: Geez, uh... sorry Daph.
Shaggy Rogers: (with his arm sticking out) Like, down this street.
(Nothing in the street)

Daphne Blake: There's no one here now.
Shaggy Rogers: We thought we'd gotten away from the first 3 witches, when this ghost chased us from down there.
Ben Ravencroft: First 3 witches?
Velma Dinkley: Hmm... you said she threw fire balls right?
Shaggy Rogers: It was like this, Velma. (Points at the shirt) But a thousand times worse.
Velma Dinkley: Is this the street she chased you guys?
Shaggy Rogers: Like don't remind us.
Fred Jones: Hey check out this branches. They were all broken from the tops of these trees.
Daphne Blake: And in a perfectly straight line.
Velma Dinkley: This is getting interesting Ben.
(They hear rock music)

Scooby-Doo: Shaggy!

Shaggy Rogers: Like not again!

Daphne Blake: What is that?

Velma Dinkley: Let's go see.

(They go to the where the music is coming from)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, where are you going?

(The gang are walking in the forest until they see the Hex Girls on the stage)

Girl: Hit it sisters. (hisses like a vampire)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! It's the witches!

Fred Jones: Easy guys. It's just the Hex Girls.

(Then they play their song)

I'm gonna cast a spell on you.
You're gonna do what I want you to.
Mix it up here in my little bowl,
say a few words and you lose control.

I'm a Hex Girl
and I'm gonna put a spell on you.
I'm gonna put a spell on you.
I'm a Hex Girl
and I'm gonna put a spell on you.
Put a spell on you!

You'll feel the fog
as I cloud your mind.
You'll get dizzy
when I make a sign.
You'll wake up in the dead of night,
missing me when I'm out of sight.

I'm a Hex Girl
and I'm gonna put a spell on you.
I'm gonna put a spell on you.
I'm a Hex Girl
and I'm gonna put a spell on you.
Oh yeah!

With this little cobweb potion,
you'll fall into dark devotion.
If you ever lose affection,
I can change your whole direction.

I'm a Hex Girl
and I'm gonna put a spell on you.
I'm gonna put a spell on you.
I'm a Hex Girl
and I'm gonna put a spell on you.
We're gonna put a spell on all of you!

(The gang start clapping)

Girl #1: Thanks. What are you doing here?

Girl #2: The concert's tommorow.

Girl #3: Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you Ben Ravencroft?

Ben Ravencroft: Why? You not gonna bite me, are you?

Girl #1: Cool, I always wanted to meet you. You're like one of us.

Girl #3: Yeah, you under what we're into.

(Scooby and Shaggy look at each other until the girl with pig tails sees them)

Girl #2: Hi.

Shaggy and Scooby: (scared) Hello.

Fred Jones: That's quite an act, Ms. uh...

Girl #1: Thorn. This is Dusk, and Luna. We're eco goths.

Shaggy and Scooby: "Eco goths?"

Dusk: And we don't need your approval.

Fred Jones: Geez all those explosions at the end are mystifying. Eh, Velma?

Velma Dinkley: Yeah, very mystifying.

Ben Ravencroft: So... where are you girls from?

Thorn: Oakhaven, but we won't be here for long. We're close to cutting our first CD. Well, it's been killer meeting ya.

(Thorn and Ben shake their hands)

Ben Ravencroft: Same here.

Thorn: But we better get back to our rehearsal.

(The Hex Girls leaves to go back to their rehearsal)

Fred Jones: Those Hex Girls seem kinda suspicious.

Velma Dinkley: I'll say.

Fred Jones: Daph and I will keep an eye on them.

Velma Dinkley: Gee! Why is it that you always pair off with Daphne, Fred?

Fred Jones: (Daphne blushes as Fred tries to explain to Velma on why he always pairs off with her) Uh, well.

Velma Dinkley: Never mind. It is a good idea. (to Scooby and Shaggy) You guys stay here, We wanna take another look at where the guys saw that ghost.

(Shaggy and Scooby gets scared)

Velma Dinkley: Come on.

(They left and Fred and Daphne looked at each other smiling)

(At the street)

Velma Dinkley: Let's take a look behind these trees.

(They go behind the trees, and see some tire tracks on the ground)

Velma Dinkley: What are these tire-tracks doing back here?

Ben Ravencroft: Strange the road's back there.

Velma Dinkley: Right. Let's see where these tracks lead.

Shaggy Rogers: Like can't we follow them tomorrow, like after breakfast? (gulped)

(Then, they go to a abandoned barnhouse, when Velma sees something)

Velma Dinkley: Shh.

(Then a person came out of the barn. Revealing that it was Mayor Corey)

Velma Dinkley: Jinkies, it's the mayor.

Ben Ravencroft: What's he doing here?

Velma Dinkley: I don't know, but we're going to find out what's in that barn.

Sam: Yeah, Scooby and Shaggy will follow the mayor.

Shaggy Rogers: We will?

Velma Dinkley: Fine, you check the barn and we'll follow the mayor.

(Shaggy and Scooby looked at the barnhouse and get scared)

Shaggy Rogers: On second thought, we'll take the mayor. He'll never know we're on his tail, ey, Scoob?

Scooby-Doo: Yeah.

(Shaggy accidentally stepped on Scooby's tail)

Shaggy Rogers: Oops. Sorry, Scoob.

(Scooby shakes his tail to make it fell better)

(As they split up, Meanwhile as the Mayor is walking to the street of Oakhaven, Shaggy, Scooby and the others sneak him, As the Mayor looks behind at them, but there was no one there, as he walks away, then We go to Scooby, Shaggy and the others hiding at the Mailbox and sneaks up again, As the Mayor looks at them again, but no one is there and leaves, now we go to Shaggy and Scooby hiding at the tree. They sneak up again.)

(Meanwhile at the barn, Velma is trying to open the Lock but it's still locked.)

Velma Dinkley: There's gotta be another way in here.

(As she sneaks, Then Ben follows her and sneaks quickly, now we cut to Daphne and Fred)

Daphne Blake: So Fred, why do you always pair us up?

Fred Jones: Uh, well, I thought about that for the longest time and there's never been a good time to tell you, maybe it's time that I, well that I-

(They hide as the Hex Girls walk down the walkway)

Thorn: I think we'll have to preform our ritual, girls.

Dusk: Not tonight Thorn, my powers are weak from rehearsing.

Luna: Mine too, how about tomorrow just before the concert.

Thorn: Never mind, I'll do it myself, See you in the morning, Bad dreams, sisters.

Dusk and Luna: Bad dreams, sister Thorn.

(As they go in there own ways)

Fred: Thorn seems like the leader, let's follow her.

Daphne Blake: Are you sure your not just stuck on Thorn, Freddy?

(As they Sneak to follow Thorn, they see the same woman from the puritan village)

(Now we cut to Ben Holding Velma, As she tries to get to the barn)

Velma Dinkley: Just a little higher.

Ben Ravencroft: I can't.

(As her foot puts to Ben's head)

Velma Dinkley: That's great.

Ben Ravencroft: Wonderful.

(As Velma manages to get inside to the barn, She makes crashing noises)

Ben Ravencroft: Velma, Are you okay?

Velma Dinkley: I'm fine. (She opens the door) Come on.

(Now we cut to the Mayor who was walking to the Hardware, As Shaggy, Scooby and the others are spying on him)

Shaggy Rogers: This mayor's one busy guy.

Scooby-Doo: Reah.

(They hid as the mayor comes out)

Mayor Corey: Okay, Willard. You take it easy now.

(He walks down the sidewalk, as he sees a couple kissing, smiling)

Mayor Corey: Ah, young love.

(But the couple turns out to be Shaggy and Scooby spying on him, as They looks at the Mayor, as he looks at them, but no one is there, as he gives a Package to a woman, we go to Shaggy and Scooby hiding in the bush.)

(we cut to Velma and Ben, She uses a Flashlight to discover Stairs and Tractor Truck, as she touches the truck, she can feel warm.)

Velma Dinkley: It's still warm, Ben.

Ben Ravencroft: But who will be driving it, this late at night?

Velma Dinkley: That's the mystery.

(Now we cut to Thorn who was walking home, as Fred and Daphne sneak up and see her walking to the small garage. They sneak up and as the Lights turn on the Garage, They see her doing a magic spell, Much to their shock as they hide)

Fred Jones: What's she up to?

Daphne Blake: If I didn't know better. I say that she's a witch.

(Thorn smells the magic potion.)

(Now we cut to the Mayor who was walking, then he looks behind again, and saw some shadows who was hiding, then he walks away, then Shaggy and Scooby sneak up using a hiding bush, as the Mayor goes to the warehouse, he looks behind, But he enters into the warehouse)

Shaggy Rogers: Like he won't ditch us that easily, Scoob.

(They sneak up quickly)

Shaggy Rogers: Shh.

Scooby-Doo: Yeah, shh.

(As Shaggy opens the Barn door and enters, they find nothing, then they heard bat sounds, as they sneak quietly)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, where do you think he went, Scoob?

Scooby-Doo: I don't know.

(They hear a noise, they look up and see the witch's ghost)

Witch's Ghost: How dare you disturb my resting place!

(They shout in terror)

Witch's Ghost: THIS TOWN WILL PAY!!!

(She flies toward Shaggy and Scooby.)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, send them a bill! But leave us alone!

(They go the other way, as they run through the wall and ran over the mayor and they ran into two people, that turned out to be be Velma and Ben)

Ben Ravencroft: I can't see a thing without my glasses.

Velma Dinkley: Me either.

(Velma's and Ben's hands touch each other)

Velma & Ben: Sorry.

(Velma and Ben's glasses accidentally got mixed up)

Velma & Ben: Sorry.

(They switch their glasses back)

Daphne Blake: Hey, what's going on?

Fred Jones: Well, where are they?

Velma Dinkley: That's no mystery.

(They go to a shaking mailbox)

Daphne Blake: So, what happened guys?

Shaggy Rogers: Like, we'd followed the mayor to some warehouse and that ghost attacked us.

Velma Dinkley: He did? There goes my cherry-picker theory.

Fred Jones: Cherry Picker theory?

Clover: Speaking of that, just wait till we tell you what we saw in Thorn's place.

Shaggy Rogers: Hey, Like we were aborting here first, right Scoob?

Scooby-Doo: Yeah.

Shaggy Rogers: The mayor was one busy guy. Picking things up. (Scooby land on him) And dropping things off.

Velma Dinkley: Like what?

Mayor Corey: What is going on here?! What's the big idea running over me?

(We cut to the warehouse)

Mayor Corey: As you can see, there's nothing here. Except for the damaged wall.

(The gang sees the holes)

Velma Dinkley: Sorry about that, Mayor. Scooby and Shaggy just lose it when they get scared. In fact, I'm worried that staying in Oakhaven might just be too frightening and experienced for them. I think we should leave.

Ben Ravencroft: Really?

(As Scooby licks Velma's face)

Mayor Corey: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

Velma Dinkley: But, I need to get one more clue before the night is over. Then I think I'll can solve the mystery of the Witch's ghost before tomorrow's Autumn's fest.

Mayor Corey: Oh, great, I'll do anything I can to help.

(As he leaves)

Shaggy Rogers: Like I should have known leaving, Wasn't that an option?

Daphne Blake: What was that all about, Velma?

Ben Ravencroft: You'll got a plan right?

Velma Dinkley: Here's what we're going to do.

(As she whispers about her plan)

(Now we go to the stage where the Hex Girls use to perform. Scooby removes the sheet to reveal a drum as he plays it with his tail. Next Shaggy removes the piano and plays it as well)

Dusk: Hey.

Scooby-Doo: (gulped) Sorry

(Hides in the covers)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, Why'd you stop, old buddy

Ron Stoppable: Look behind you.

Luna: No one touches my keyboard.

(Shaggy laughs scared, and hides under the sheets where Scooby and Shippo were)

Thorn: We should be resting for the concert tomorrow. We only came because Ben asked us to.

Ben Ravencroft: Hey, I'm just following orders.

Luna: So what do you want?

(The eerie wind starts to blow and the witch's ghost shows up again)

Shaggy and Scooby: Yikes!!

(The witch flies over where the people at and throws a fire ball that them)

Witch's Ghost: THIS TOWN MUST PAY FOR IT'S FOULED DEED!!

(The gang run as fast as they can, until Velma trips.)

Velma Dinkley: Help me! I have fallen and I can't get up! (The Witch's Ghost prepares to attack) Now! (The tree hits Witch's Ghost and then hits the Soccer ball net) Yes! You did it guys!

Fred Jones: Okay, let's see who's behind all this.

(Fred removes the mask reveal to be Mr. McKnight)

Shaggy Rogers: Like it's the T-Shirt guy!

Daphne Blake: Mr. McKnight, the pharmacist?

(The Hex Girls arrive.)

Thorn: Daddy?

Mr. McKnight: Hello, Sally.

Luna: Your dad's the ghost?

Fred Jones: Your real name is Sally?

Thorn: I don't believe this, daddy. Why would you do something like this?

Daphne Blake: You mean you didn't know?

Mr. McKnight: The girls have nothing to do with this.

Mayor Corey: What in the world is going on this evening? (gasps) Is that you, McKnight?

Velma Dinkley: Maybe I can explain. I found flash powder residue where Shag and Scoob saw the ghost. This is the device to throw the fireballs which was just watts of flash paper. He got it from his daughter's stage prompts.

(The device shoots a fireball and lights up the treetops, revealing a cherry picker truck)

Shaggy Rogers: Like what's that?

(Velma shines a light on the truck.)

Velma Dinkley: Its the cherry picker that made the ghost flie above the trees with the use of an extention device. And there's the fan that created the eerie wind. It took more than one person to pull of this scam. Isn't that right, Jack.

(Jack is caught)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks.

Velma Dinkley: It would take someone pretty strong to hoist Mr. McNight around.

Shaggy Rogers: You should be cooking pot roast, instead of cooking up trouble.

Velma Dinkley: That goes for all of you!!

Ben Ravencroft: All of you?

Velma Dinkley: Sure. There had to be more people involved to make this hoax work.

Mayor Corey: Well, I, for one, am shocked by this deception.

Sam: You can cut the act, Mayor, because you're the one who got us suspicious from the start. And in fact, you were the mastermind of the whole thing.

Mayor Corey: I... I...

Ben Ravencroft: I'm very disappointed in you, Mayor! And all of you! For lining your pockets by dragging Sarah Ravencroft's name through the mud!

(Scooby wags his fingers, scoldingly.)

(Now we go to Ben's place)

Thorn: She was the real wiccan?

Ben Ravencroft: That's right.

Dusk: So cool!

Thorn: She's beautiful!

Ben Ravencroft: Yes I think so too. And that's why I get upset when people accused her as a witch.

Fred Jones: I think I owe you girls an apology for thinking you were... uh...

Daphne Blake: Witches.

Dusk: Witches? We just pretend that stuff, it's just a gimmick for our band.

Luna: We're "Eco goths" kinda like Wiccans. Just ask Thorn, she is one.

Thorn: Yeah right, Sally McKnight. 1/16 blood on my mother's side. And that ritual you saw, was just peppermint and cloves to sove my vercal cords. You think it's easy singing this stuff.

Dusk: Thorn's herbal vapor is awesome. We all use it before and after every show.

Shaggy Rogers: But, what about your fangs?

Luna: My dad's a dentist. (gets out her fake fang) He outfitted the band.

(The fang scares Scooby as he jumps on Shaggy)

Shaggy Rogers: Like we knew it all along, right, Scoob?

(Scooby shows his fangs scaring Shaggy as he jumps and holds on to Luna and then she drops him.)

Ben Ravencroft: Mayor?

Mayor Corey: We've been ringing your doorbell for sometime and...

Ben Ravencroft: Sorry about that. I really need to fix that thing for years. What's up, man?

Mayor Corey: Well Ben... I feel really bad about everything and I wanted to apologize for using your ancestors in our little publicity stunt.

Mr. McKnight: The tourist trade was so slow. We we're desperated.

Mayor Corey: Right, and you once told me that supernatural phenomenal always attracts people.

Mr. McKnight: It was natural to use Sarah because.. (sighs) we accidentally dug up her grave.

Ben Ravencroft: What grave?

Mayor Corey: I'm sorry, Ben. But you see I lied to you when you asked me that if we advice of Sarah's, while we we're building the puritan village.

Mr. McKnight: We did. It was her grave marker. We found it in a bulldoze pile of dirt and rocks, we don't want to upset you.

Mayor Corey: But that's all we found no bones.

Ben Ravencroft: No, book?

Mr. McKnight: Nothing but that grave marker. We swear, Ben.

Mayor Corey: We don't even know where her grave is?

Mr. McKnight: It's true, it could be anywhere between miller's creek and tree stumb.

(Velma thinks of something and sees the portrait of Sarah)

Velma Dinkley: Shaggy. You still have the shoe buckel, Scooby found today?

Shaggy Rogers: Like this one? (Gives it to her) Here.

Velma Dinkley: Scooby, can you show me exactly where you found this?

Scooby-Doo: I think so.

(Now we go outside of the gang searching for the book)

Scooby-Doo: There! (Points at the stump)

Ben Ravencroft: All these years I was searching the wrong oak tree.

Velma Dinkley: Right. I believe this is was left of the tree where Sarah did her healing. You never even noticed it because it was cut down hundreds of years ago. It's up to you to dig it, Scooby.

Scooby-Doo: Nuh-uh.

Velma Dinkley: Then how about a Scooby-Snax?

Scooby-Doo: Nuh-uh, no way.

Velma Dinkley: Two Scooby-Snax?

Scooby-Doo: Okay.

(Scooby eats two pieces of Scooby-Snax and then digs into the ground. He then stops digging.)

Ben Ravencroft: What did you find?

Scooby-Doo: Rox!

Ben Ravencroft: Rocks?

(Scooby pulls out a box.)

Velma Dinkley: The box!

(Ben gets excited a little to see the box)

Daphne Blake: You okay, Ben?

Ben Ravencroft: Just a little exicted.

(He open the box to reveal a spell book)

Daphne Blake: It looks kinda evil belonging to a wiccan healer.

Velma Dinkley: Ben, that doesn't seem to be a journal at all.

Ben Ravencroft: (sinisterly) Because it isn't, Velma. It's a spell book.

(Velma gasps)

Ben Ravencroft: You see, Sarah wasn't a Wiccan. She was indeed, a witch.

(The others are surprised)

Thorn: A real witch?

Dusk: Heavy.

Ben Ravencroft: Since Sarah's blood runs in my vines, I guess that makes me... a warlock.

Scooby: Warlock?

Ben Ravencroft: The wiccans imprisoned Sarah in her own spell book! And you helped me find it.

Velma Dinkley: (angered) You lied to me, Ben!

Ben Ravencroft: Well, gee. I have to I'd been searching for years. Then I read about your exploits. (Cut to a flashback) I knew if anyone can help me find the book. It was you and your friends! I orchestrated the whole mummy scheme paying off the archaeologists and the security guards just to lure you to the museum so we can met. (Flashback ends) Yes, Velma. I tricked you into helping me, and it worked.

Fred Jones: (to Mayor Corey and Mr. McKnight) You were in on Ben's plan, too!

Mayor Corey: Huh? No! We're surprised as you are, uh, honest!

Ben Ravencroft: For once, he's telling the truth. That stupid fake ghost was the town's idea. But it did work to my advantage.

Samantha: But why go through this crazy scheme? Why not just asked us to find the book?

Velma Dinkley: I know why. Because if we know what that book was, we would never have helped him!

Ben Ravencroft: But even you can't imagine the real power of this book. No mere mortal can.

Fred Jones: You've been reading too many of your own horror stories, Ravencroft.

Ben Ravencroft: A typical mortal response, but I am descended from a superior breed. I shall unlock the power of the imprisoned Sarah Ravencroft!

Shaggy Rogers: Like, I don't like the sound of this!

Scooby-Doo: Me either!

Ben Ravencroft: Together, we shall reign supreme! (He recites a spell.) Let the evil from the past breathe again with fiery blast!

(Dark clouds loom above.)

Velma Dinkley: No!

Ben Ravencroft: Let the dark wind with the night to blow away the force of light!

Shaggy Rogers: Like I know what comes next, guys. Big Trouble!

(The tree falls down.)

Ben Ravencroft: Now we summoned ancient power!

Velma Dinkley: (pleading) Ben, please stop!

Ben Ravencroft: This is evil's finest hour!

(The spell appears and drains on Ben)

Velma Dinkley: No!

Ben Ravencroft: What's the matter, Velma? (takes off his glasses) Don't you like the new and improved Ben Ravencroft?

Velma Dinkley: No! Frankly, I don't!

Ben Ravencroft: Well, get used to it. (He looks at Corey and McKnight running away.) Leaving so soon? The party is just beginning! (He uses his powers to Trap Corey and McKnight into the pillory.)

Mayor Corey: Let us out!

Thorn: Daddy!

(As the girls try to save him)

Ben Ravencroft: Oh how deepling moving. (He uses his powers to trap The Hex Girls and uses a yarn to tie it up) Can I Spin a yarn or what?

Velma Dinkley: How could I ever liked your novels?! Now, guys! Grab the book!

(As Daphne and Fred grabs Ben)

Fred Jones: Gotcha!

(But Ben jumps to escape)

Daphne Blake: Where'd he go?!

(Then We see Ben on the Roof)

Ben Ravencroft: This isn't fun at your silly little mysteries, You can't solve me so easily.

(Ben unleashes a fire spell around the gang as he laughs evilly)

Velma Dinkley: You won't get away with this, Ben Ravencroft!

Ben Ravencroft: Why? Because of you meddling kids?

Fred Jones: Hey, we're not kids!? But enough of this minner magic! I want to see how powerful I can really be! It's time to summon Sarah Ravencroft! (recites the spell) "Dreadful darkness, hear my cry! Bring back one who cannot die!"

(Then, the Mystery Machine comes in interrupting his spell putting out the fire, and it Scooby opens the door from inside the van)

Daphne Blake: Are we ever glad to see you!

(They get inside the van)

Fred Jones: Nice going guys!

Shaggy Rogers: Like we're going alright. Away from Witchville!

(As Ben uses his powers to attack the van, But it hits the tree)

Shaggy Rogers: Book? Can it just wait till the movies?

(As the van knock over the pumpkins causing it to roll out and Hitting Ben Ravencroft, As Scooby steals the Book from Ben)

Shaggy Rogers: You're the man, Scoob!

(As Ben gets up, He uses his powers to blow the van's tire, causing the Mystery machine to go out of control and Crashes through the Gift Shop and destroyed it, as Mayor Corey and Mr. McKnight freaked out of seeing it)

Mayor Corey: Not the gift shop!!

(As Ben Ravencroft uses his powers to blow the second tire, causing the van to go out of control and goes into the hay, much to everyone's disgust)

Shaggy Rogers: Looks like I'm starting to get the hang of this.

(As the van is about to crash Corey and Mcknight, but misses, However, as the van crashes smashes to the Turkey Farm, Ben uses his powers to destroy the third tire and causes the van to slow down)

Shaggy Rogers: Well, at least we have one tire.

(Then the last tire gets flattened)

(Ben jumps in front of the Mystery Machine and grabs the book)

Ben Ravencroft: I'll take that! (Jumps back and continues reciting) Now, where was I. "Dreadful darkness, hear my cry! Bring back one who cannot die! Let the witch who perished here live again and reappear!"

(The ghost of Sarah Ravencroft appears)

Ben Ravencroft: In my wildest dreams, I could never have imagined such an imposing creature.

Sarah Ravencroft: Thank thee. Thou canst not know what my bondage have been like. Who art thou?

Ben Ravencroft: Ben Ravencroft, your descendant. From the modern world.

Sarah Ravencroft: Modern? (looks around) Not much seem to have changed.

Mayor Corey: Please, don't hurt us!

Sarah Ravencroft: The same pathetic peasants, graveling for their puny lives.

Ben Ravencroft: But. (his hand get slapped away) Sarah, I want to become more powerful, like you.

Sarah Ravencroft: Thou, Jest.

Ben Ravencroft: But it was I who released you, you should serve me.

Sarah Ravencroft: I serve no one, least wise a worm like thee. Aye Thou has freed me, so now I can punish the world for my long imprisonment. (Sarah uses her evil magic vapor to make all things decay and turn to ash) I shall create an era of darkness over this land! (laughing evilly)

(The spell is heading towards Shaggy and Scooby)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, we're goners, Scoob!

(Shaggy and Scooby quickly gets out of the wheel before they could get vaporized by the spell)

Ben Ravencroft: This isn't how I envisioned. We were supposed to rule the world together, not destroy it!

Sarah Ravencroft: I care not for thy whims. Cross my path and I shall destroy thee along with thy world!

Ben Ravencroft: But I have the book. And I shall return you back into the book. "Ancient evil get thee hence only good can recompense for the-"

Sarah Ravencroft : (Laughing evilly) Thinkest thou art a Wiccan, only a virtous soul can imprision me. (She traps Ben in a green ball) (Laughing evilly)

(With the gang)

Velma Dinkley: I've got an idea, guys.But we need that book.

Shaggy Rogers: Like not again!

Ben Ravencroft: No, Let me out!

(Shaggy picks up the book)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks. Like this is almost too easy.
Sarah Ravencroft: The book cannot help thee.
(They see her and they run from her)

Sarah Ravencroft: DO MY BIDDING, BIRD!! Get them!
(She enlarges a turkey and sends it after Shaggy and Scooby)

Shaggy Rogers: A turkey? (laughs) Even we're not scared of that- (They see the turkey) Like, now we are!
(They run off, as the giant turkey gives the chase. As Daphne and Fred tries to run off, but The Monster Pumpkin grabs ber)

(Then Sarah Ravencroft appears)

Sarah Ravencroft: I believe thou hast something that is mine.
(She uses her powers to blast the door but misses them.)

Giant turkey: Uh-oh.

Thorn: Thanks.
Luna: I am outta here.
Dusk: Yeah, that witch is the real thing.
(Thorn tries to go with them, but Velma stopped her)

Velma Dinkley: Wait Thorn, we need your help.
Thorn: Me? What can I do?
Velma Dinkley: We need you to read the spell to defeat Sarah Ravencroft.
Thorn: Are you crazy?! I'm not really a witch, I can't help you against her!
Velma Dinkley: But you said you were part wiccan.
Thorn: Only 1/16th.
Velma Dinkley: It doesn't matter. You have wiccan blood, meaning you can read the spell so you can send Sarah Ravencroft back to where she came from.
Thorn: Forget it! You don't even have the book.
Daphne Blake: No, Scooby does.
(Shaggy and Scooby are running with the book in Scooby's mouth)

Velma Dinkley: Scooby! Over here!
(Scooby tries to get to Velma and Thorn, until Sarah grabs Scooby's tail as she takes the book from him)

Sarah Ravencroft: Give me my book, you meddling hound.
Scooby-Doo: Hound? Where?
(Shaggy realizes Sarah captures Scooby)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! (Gets a bucket of water) Let my buddy go, you creepy crone! (splashes water on her)
Sarah Ravencroft: What was that?
Shaggy Rogers: You're not melting! Like, it worked in "The Wizard of Oz!"
Sarah Ravencroft: Fool, I shall destroy thee!

Shaggy Rogers: I'll hold that for ya. (leaves)
(The bucket explodes as Sarah grows in anger and unleashes her magic to make the pumpkins come to life as monsters.)

Sarah Ravencroft: Bring me that book!
(The pumpkins grab Shaggy.)

Shaggy Rogers: (tosses the book to Scooby) Scoob!
(Scooby catches the book)

Sarah Ravencroft: ENOUGH!!!
(She makes a tree come to life, and it grabs Scooby.)

Scooby-Doo: Rikes! (tosses the book to Daphne) Daphne!
(Daphne catches the book, but the root gets her.)

(As the Roots try to get the book, Velma grabs it.)

Velma Dinkley: Here's the spell. It's up to you, Thorn.
(As the Sprouts grow)

Sarah Ravencroft: (laughs) The book is useless to a mere mortal!
(Then suddenly, the book's magic wilted the root)

Velma Dinkley: But not to a Wiccan.
Sarah Ravencroft: Nay! I'll stop thee myself!
(She flies closer to them)

Velma Dinkley: Hurry Thorn, read!
Thorn: "Ancient evil, get thee hence. Only good can recompense for the misdeeds that you done. Witch return from when you come!"
(Then a blue force of magic pushes Sarah, as she screams far to the ground, as the roots go down)

Velma Dinkley: Thorn! It's working!
(Sarah gets up and gasps in horror. The living tree goes back to be a normal tree letting Scooby go, and the pumpkins go back to normal and lets go of Shaggy)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks!!
Sarah Ravencraft: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! (gets pulled in by the book, screaming) NOT AGAIN!!

(She and Ben get pulled in.)

Ben Ravencraft: No! (struggles to get away) NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
(He finally gets sucked into the book. The friends slowly walk over to the book, but the burnt tree branch falls on the book and burns, trapping Ben and Sarah.)

Velma Dinkley: Ben Ravencroft's last book is one the world will never buy.
Daphne Blake: Thank goodness.
Shaggy Rogers: But like, it would have been a hot fast seller.
(Then, the Hex Girls set the Mayor and Mr. McKnight free)

Thorn: Daddy! (She goes to hug her father) Are you okay?
Mr. McKnight: You're the one I was worried about, honey. But, you did it! I guess you are a witch after all.
Thorn: A wiccan, daddy. A wiccan.
(The mayor sees the destroyed village caused by Sarah Ravencroft ruined and panics.)

Mayor Corey: This is a disaster! No witch! No village! What are we gonna do for our Autumn Fest!?
Thorn: Well, you still got the Hex Girls.
Mayor Corey: No offense, girls but, we need a bigger attraction.
Shaggy Rogers: Uh, mayor?
(The Mayor sees the giant turkey, who thinks he's going cook him for dinner.)

(The fog clears up and Thorn and the girl are singing "Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air)

Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air.

We may look bad but we don't care.
We ride the wind, we feel the fire,
To love the earth is our one desire (to love the earth is our one desire).

Love the earth it's only fair,
It's one big earth that we must share.
We love the earth with all our fire!
It's in our souls our one desire.

Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air.

We may look bad but we don't care.
We ride the wind, we feel the fire,
To love the earth is our one desire (to love the earth is our one desire).

Nature is a precious gift it will make your spirits lift.
Love the earth with all your fire!
It's in your soul your one desire.

Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air!

We may look bad but we don't care.
We ride the wind, we feel the fire.
To love the earth is our one desire
To love the earth... is our one desire!

(The crowd applauds)

Scooby-Doo: Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

(The movie ends)
