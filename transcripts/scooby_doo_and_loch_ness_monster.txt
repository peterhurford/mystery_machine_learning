(The movie begins underwater of Loch Ness lake as the credits role)

"Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster"

(Now we go to the surface is where we see a small boat with a banner on top that says "Highland Games" inside the boat we see many people dancing in celebration one man is playing the violin as the music ends everyone cheered as we see a woman was behind the boat watching the lake at night)

Man #1: Let's hear a few words from our fair hostes.
Man #2: Come on, Shannon. Give us a speech.
People: Speech! Speech!
Shannon Blake: On behalf of the Blake clan, myself included... I want to welcome all of our mighty competitors... to the first ever Loch Ness Highland Games.
(Everyone cheered)

Shannon Blake: And I wanted to thank all of the volunteers who helped us transform... the ancient grounds of Blake Castle into a first-rate tournament field.
Angus Haggart: Now the Blakes can finally be known for something, besides getting themselves into trouble, eh, Shannon?
Shannon Blake: I just hope we can survive the embarrassment should you be our winning contestant, Angus Haggart.
(Colin grabs Angus)

Colin Haggart: That's me brother, you be speaking to, lassie. And if anyone's got claim to be embarrassed by him, it's me.
Angus Haggart: Aye, then. What do you say we start the games early? Biggest splash wins.
Colin Haggart: Oh, you're one.
Shannon Blake: Wait! No!
(It was too late for her to stop them as Colin and Angus jumps in the water much to many people's excitement and laughing)

Shannon Blake: Please guys get back in the boat.
Colin Haggart: What? Afraid of the legend of the loch might be coming back for a midnight snack?
Shannon Blake: This isn't funny!
Colin Haggart: If you would know any better, Shannon Blake. I'd be thinking you believe in the Loch Ness Monster.
(Suddenly something is surfarcing in the water, as Colin and Angus tries to get back to the boat. They see a silhouetted creature with red eyes appearing in the dark water)

Colin Haggart: What the?
(The creature swims towards the boat)

Shannon Blake: No, it cannot be!
(The creature hits the boat as many people screams in panic and two people falls off the boat)

Shannon Blake: Colin! Angus! Get out of the water now!
(Colin and Angus swims to get out of the water as quickly as possible)

Shannon Blake: Hold on! (She tries to drive the boat to escape, but it gets stuck by two anchors)
Man: We're double-anchored. She won't move an inch until we hoist them up.
(The monster hits the boat again, two chains connected to the anchors broke as the monster pushes the boat towards the shore)

Shannon Blake: Brace yourselves!
(The boat crashes into the shore)

Angus: Are you alright, Shannon?
Duncan MacGubbin: SILENCE! (Many people looked up to see Duncan) For a thousand years it has swam in the shadows below. You have disturbed the spirit that haunts these waters. Yoo afraid to sleep at night? Trembling in your beds with fright? 'Tis not the darkness drawing near... but the "Loch Ness Monster" you should fear.
(The lightning storm was heard as Shannon was afraid hearing what Duncan said about the Loch Ness Monster)

(The next morning, Scotland is a peaceful place and later we see the Mystery Machine)

Daphne Blake: How beautiful. This Scottish countryside is so lush and green.
Fred Jones: Yeah. Just like a giant golf course.
Velma Dinkley: Jinkies, Daphne. It must be exciting to visit Blake Castle the ancient home of your Scottish ancestors.
Daphne Blake: It sure is. And I can't wait to help my cousin Shannon, host the Loch Ness Highland Games. (Brings out her scarf) I'm planning to wear this for the opening ceremonies... in honor of the Blakes of Loch Ness.
Shaggy Rogers: Like it's not the Blakes of Loch Ness that I'm worried about.
Velma Dinkley: Are you, by chance, referring to the legend of the Loch Ness Monster?
Scooby-Doo: Monster? (Scooby runs)
Shaggy Rogers: Yeah. And like, why are we going to some place that's already got a monster named after it?
Scooby-Doo: (Pops out of Shaggy's shirt) Makes no sense.
Fred Jones: Yeah. Legend of the Loch. Get real. It's just another big fake, right, Velma?
Velma Dinkley: I'm not so sure about that.
Daphne Blake: Jeepers! You believe in the Loch Ness Monster, Velma?
Shaggy Rogers: Like, that makes three of us.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah. One, two, three.
Velma Dinkley: I believe it's a mystery. This monster is different. There have been over 2000 Loch Ness Monster sightings... dating all the way back to 540 A.D. That's almost 1,500 years ago.
Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! Like, a monster that's been scaring people for more than a thousand years.
Shaggy Rogers: Good thinking pal. it'll take than rainstorm to our spirits huh?
(Then the Loch Ness Monster appears behind Shaggy and Scooby as they scream in terror)

(They run for their lives while the Loch Ness Monster chases them in hot pursuit as the song "Brothers Forever" plays)

(???)

(The weight toss was too heavy as it hits Nessie on the head and screams in pain, then Scooby and Shaggy lands on it's head and then slides down off of the monster flying in horizon as they crash into a tent and then collapses upon them)

Shaggy Rogers: Like zoinks! It's right outside!
(Then we see a shadow approaching them. Then the collapsing tent was removed reveals to be Fred and the others)

Fred Jones: It's Sakura, Jeri, Shaggy and Scooby.
Shaggy & Scooby: Huh?
Fred Jones: Guys, what happened?
Shaggy Rogers: Scooby. Stomach. Bats. Kitchen. Rainstorm. Chase. Monster.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, monster.

Pembrooke: Look around, the prove is all around us.
