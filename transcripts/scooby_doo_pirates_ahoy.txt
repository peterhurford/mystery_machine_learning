Man: Dr. Garcia.
Rupert Garcia: Oh please, call me Rupert.
Man: Just wanted to let you know we're about to enter...
Rupert Garcia: The Bermuda Triangle. I can tell by the stars. Better than any compass.
Man: This place gives me the creeps.
Rupert Garcia: (laughs) Vanishing ships, sea monsters, aliens: All legends. Don't let them spook you. Anyway... ...we'll be out here a few more nights... ...and then my star map will finally be complete.
Man: Whatever you say, doc.
Rupert Garcia: We'll all be home safe and sound before you know it.
(Then we see Garcia in his office as he tries to figure out the star map, and drinks his coffee. Then cut to the captain and the sailor, as the sailor sees something strange)

Sailor: (gasps) Captain! You better take a look at this.
(They see the compass going around clockwise, and cut to the watchman who sees fog in his binocalars)

Watchman: Fog! Dead ahead!
(Then the flag stops as the fog comes blinding everyone suddenly some zombie looking pirates climb up the ship scaring the man and carry him away)

Sailor: Who's there?
(The captain appears climbing up while he was laughing)

Foolscap: Prepare to meet you're worst nightmare!
(In the room Garcia hears screaming coming from outside and looks to see his crew are running from the pirates)

Rupert Garcia: What the heck?!
(Then suddenly Garcia sees a pirate ship coming this way, as they bring out cannons)

Rupert Garcia: Mayday! Mayday! We're under attack!
Spectre: Pirates, fire!
(The pirate ship fires a cannon almost destroying half of the ship, we see Garcia is hiding under the table as he sees the Pirates walking in)

Pirate #1: Here it be, captain.
Captain Skunkbeard: Ah, perfect. But now where is he?
Pirate #1: Maybe with rest of the crew.
Captain Skunkbeard: Blimey, hold on hails below in the bills will sold them out later.
(Then Garcia sees the Pirates and the Villains paddle back to the fog)

Rupert Garcia: It can't be, ghost pirates?
(Then the cannon fires flooding the ship into the water, and the ship sank, as Captain Skunkbeared laughs as the ship leaves)

(At the Mystery Machine the gang is on their way to a place for Fred's birthday)

Shaggy Roggers: Finally, a trip where there are no monsters... ghosts, aliens, mummies or haunted tikis. Nothing but R, R and R: Rest, relaxation and round-the-clock eats.
Velma: In other words, a cruise.
Daphne: Just sun, fun, and-
Scooby: A buffet?
(They laugh)

Velma Dinkley: Hey, Fred, it sure was nice of your parents to invite us all on a cruise for your birthday.
Daphne Blake: So, Freddy, how old are you going to be?
Fred Jones: Forty-three.
(Everyone were shocked, but turns out Fred was trying to find the pier)

Fred Jones: Forty-four, 45... Pier 45. This is it.
(Everyone gets out of the mystery machine)

Shaggy Rogers: No mysteries for a whole week. Midnight buffets and twenty four hours of laundry. (laughs) That's what I call living large.
Scooby: Extra large!
(As Scooby walks he sees a creepy looking person with hypnosis and scares him)

Fred Jones: What's going on guys?
Shaggy Rogers: I don't know something spooked, Scooby.
(Scooby makes the creepy face)

Shaggy Rogers: A little scary dude.
Scooby: Yeah.
Velma Dinkley: There's no one around here like that. Unless you think hawaiian sure is black socks and sandals are scary.
Daphne Blake: They are, very, very scary.
Shaggy Rogers: Buddy, you need this vacation more than I realized.
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh.
(Later they all bring out suitcase)

???: I hope you brought your sea legs.
(Then a camera flash appears out of nowhere blinding the heroes)

Velma Dinkley: And a new set of eyeballs.
Fred Jones: Pop!
Skip Jones: Freddy! Hey, say... slide one by, hands to the sky. Well, thumbs up.
Fred Jones: Thumbs down,
Skip Jones: Thumbs around, lost and found.
Fred Jones: Love you, Pop.
Skip Jones: Love you, too, through the woods.
Peggy Jones: Freddy, my baby. Oh, it's my handsome baby boy. Have you ever seen such a good-looking boy? Give me some sugar. (kissing Freddy)
Fred Jones: Mom, not in front of the gang.
Skip Jones: Hon, leave the boy alone.
Peggy Jones: Oh, yeah, but he's just so sweet and delicious.
Daphne Blake: Sure is great to see you again, Mr. And Mrs. Jones.
Peggy Jones: Yeah, you, too, dear. My, my, haven't you blossomed. I hope you girls are taking good care of my special little guy.
Fred Jones: Mom.
Peggy Jones: And Velma... you look smart as ever... but you have to let me show you my new Suzi Jay cosmetics. They'll bring a little color to your face. You'll never get a beau unless you add a little glow.
Velma Dinkley: (laughs and blushes) Thank you?
Peggy Jones: You betcha. Oh, and Norville, you're growing like a weed. But you're much too thin, dear. Are you eating enough?
Shaggy Rogers: Twenty-four square meals a day.
Velma Dinkley: And that's still not enough.
Peggy Jones: Oh, yeah? (She touches Shaggy's nose) Then you need to try my 10-pound pound cake. It will put some meat on your bones. I have one in here somewhere.
Fred Jones: Mom.
Skip Jones I'll take it from here, hon. Shake, boy. (Scooby leans to him) Just shake, no lick.
(But Scooby licks him)

Skip Jones: Okay, thanks.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, he only shakes when he's scared.
