(The movie begins as we see space then we see the title "Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders" then we see the man listening to the radio screams in pain when he almost got deaf from a loud sound)

Lauren: What happened?
Max: I've got a blast from something.
Lauren: Hey, your right. It's almost 1.20 on the meter.
(Max puts his headphones back on)

Max: I don't hear it anymore.
Steve: Hey, what's going on?
Lauren: We just got a reading.
Max: A loud one.
Steve: You're kidding.
(He goes to the scanner)

Max: Well, whatever it was it's gone now.
Steve: Look I know you both want to work another shift here but I need to get some rest, too.
Max: Well, we earned our pay from Uncle Sam today
Lauren: Yeah, who knows we might have reached someone out there.
Steve: Maybe they're already here.
(The scan shows a dot)

(Now we go to the Shaggy and Scooby are driving the mystery machine in the sandstorm while they are listening and dancing to rock music)

Shaggy Rogers: Rock on, Scoob!
Velma Dinkley: Would you guys mind keeping it down, we're trying to get some sleep back here.
Shaggy Rogers: Like we we're gonna wake you up anyway, Velma. There's a town coming up and we need to stop for some chow.
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh!
Fred Jones: (Yawning as he looks at his watch on his right wrist) But we just had dinner two hours ago.
Shaggy Rogers: Yeah, but all this driving is making me hungry. Besides that's like 14 hours indog time
Scooby-Doo: Yeah. (Scooby holds his breath and shows them his rib cages)
Daphne Blake: This dust storm's really picking up.
(The dust blocks Shaggy's path while driving)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, I can't see a thing!
(Shaggy drives the right side of the road without noticing the sign that says "No Trespassing. United States Government")

Fred Jones: Hey! What's with this road?
Daphne Blake: And what's with that sound?
(Then we see a light came out of nowhere behind the gangs, we get to see a large object flying above the mystery machine. The light blinds the heroes and then crashes into the catcus)

Fred Jones: Is everyone all right?
Shaggy Rogers: I'm okay.
(The gangs get out of the van)

Velma Dinkley: What was that thing?
Shaggy Rogers: I don't know, but it sure was big.
Velma Dinkley: Was it some kind of jet?
Fred Jones: Not like any jet I've ever seen. Did you see how fast it was?
(Suddenly, they hear a bang from inside the Mystery Machine. Velma opens the van's hood as it lets out a steam.)

Velma Dinkley: (coughing) Looks like the radiator's finished.
Shaggy Rogers: Now what?
Fred Jones: That looks like a town. Can't be more than a mile away.
Shaggy Rogers: Like you want us to walk across the desert... at night?
Fred Jones: Well I'm not gonna carry ya.
Shaggy Rogers: But there's snakes and stuff out there.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, a rattlesnake. (He mimics a rattlesnake)
Shaggy Rogers: Hey! I got an idea. How about if Scoob and I stayed to guard the mystery machine.
Velma Dinkley: That's a very brave thing to do, Scooby. Thank you.
Scooby-Doo: Your welcome.
Fred Jones: All right, let's go.
Daphne Blake: We'll be back with some help.
Shaggy Rogers: And bring back some food, too!
(They all leave for the village.)

Shaggy Rogers: I know where Velma keeps the stash, Scoob!
Scooby: Oh, boy!
(They pick up the Scooby-Snax to eat but only to discover is the last one)

Shaggy Rogers: No! Like, it's the last one!
(As Scooby tries to pick the last one, but they began to fight)

Shaggy Rogers: Hey, Let go!
Scooby-Doo: No it's mine!
Shaggy Rogers: No, it's mine!
(As they continue to fight over the last Scooby Snax, it flies and rolls over to the small crack, but it is stopped for a moment)

Shaggy Rogers: C'mon, buddy. We'll split it 50-50.
(Then a Jackalope appears and eats the last one)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks. A jackalope! I thought those things were fake.
Scooby-Doo: Me, too!
Shaggy Rogers: Hey, Put that down!
(They chased the jackalope for the Scooby Snack)

Shaggy Rogers: Come back here, you little horned thief!
(The jackalope go under the fence as the friends follow it, but now it's gone.)

Shaggy Rogers: Man, he's gone. (sees a glow) What's with that glow?
Scooby-Doo: I don't know.
(Then the shadows of two figures appear behind them)

Shaggy Rogers: Like there's something creepy behind us, isn't there?
Scooby-Doo: (Turns to see silhouettes) Yeah. Real creepy.
(The shadows reveals to be aliens)

Shaggy Rogers: Yep, that's creepy alright.
(They run off in terror while the aliens chases them as the song "Scooby-Doo! Where Are You" plays)

Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
We got some work to do now.
Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now.

Come on Scooby-Doo I see you.
pretending you got a sliver.
You're not fooling me,'cause I can see,
the way you shake and shiver.

You know we got a mystery to solve,
so Scooby-Doo, be ready for your act.
Don't hold back
And, Scooby-Doo, if you come through,
you're going to have yourself a Scooby Snack!
That's a fact!

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, here are you.
You're ready and you're willing.
If we can count on you, Scooby-Doo,
I know we'll catch that villain.

(The two friends crash inside the small restaurant)

Velma Dinkley: Now what?
Shaggy Rogers: L-l-like... Aliens are after us!
Scooby-Doo: Yeah! Aliens!
(Fred looks outside to see no aliens are outside)

Fred Jones: Aliens? We don't see any.
Shaggy Rogers: It's true! They were green and slimy and had big bug eyes! They were eight feet tall and glowing and had long creepy fingers.
(Scooby growls acting like a alien)

Shaggy Rogers: And and... (Goes to the doughnuts) Are those glazed?
(They started eating each one of the doughnuts)

Fred Jones: So, what about these aliens?
Dottie: No big deal, darlin'. Lots of people have seen them.
Sergio: Yeah, that's why we all don't go out much after dark.
Velma Dinkley: Have you seen them too?
Dottie: No, just the strange lights and the funny sounds at night.
Velma Dinkley: Wow.
Dottie: (point to an old man) But he was taken aboard.
Old man: I told you they're real! Them aliens are here to take over the world!
Dottie: That there is Lester. He's a little tetched.
Seigio: Lester, I told you to keep it down or you'll have to leave!
(Lester mumbles in frustration, and sits back down)

Sergio: He's think they experimented on him
Shaggy Rogers: Experimented?
Sergio: About a month ago, some local cattle vanished overnight without a trace.
Dot: Yeah. A lot of folks moved out of town.
(Some go to Lester, but Shaggy and Scooby sit still when Sergio gives them more food.)

Sergio: You like to eat, no?
(They go to Lester)

Velma Dinkley: Um, excuse me. But we understand that you've had some contact with aliens.
Lester: That's right, young lady. Take me aboard the ship that did.
Velma Dinkley: Really?
Lester: Settle down.
(Everyone sits down as Lester begins to tell the story)

Lester: The aliens just like your friends said. I was out last night...
(Flashback starts)

Lester (V.O.): By Scorpion Ridge. There was this loud humming sound. And a bright light came up from behind me. And the light got brighter! And brighter! Then I blacked out. I woke up strapped to a cold metal table inside a spaceship. These aliens were looking down at me. They stuck a bunch of wires on my head. They told me not to worry 'cause they just wanted to ask me... some questions?
(Flashback ends)

Velma Dinkley: What kind of questions?
Lester: Like who I was... and what I'd seen that night, but then...
(Outside we didn't hear what Lester was saying about his story as everyone gasp in horror)

Daphne Blake: And then what?
Lester: I don't remember much after that. I woke up the next morning, outside of my house.
(Shaggy and Scooby continue eating)

Fred Jones: Has anyone else in town has this experience?
Lester: Don't know. If they had, they ain't telling it.
Daphne Blake: Ohh, that's creepy.
Lester: So, you youngings better watch out, or they'll take you aboard their spaceship, too!!
(He accidentally knocks a burger off of Dottie's hand)

Dottie: (yelping) Lester!
Lester: Sorry, Dottie, it was an accident.
Dottie: Doh! What a mess!
Velma Dinkley: Don't worry, Scooby will take care of it.
(Scooby was going to eat the fallen burger, but Shaggy ate it before he does so)

Velma Dinkley: Gotta be quicker on the draw there, Scooby.
Dottie: Hey, Serge! I finally amit somebody who likes your cooking.
Sergio: Haha. Very funny.
Fred Jones: So Lester, do you have any prove that you were abducted?
Lester: Yep. I got pictures.
Velma Dinkley: Could we see them?!
(Lester nods)

(Now we go to the gangs and Lester enters a house and sees all the alien collections)

Lester: Well, come on in.
(The gangs are amazed by the collection)

Velma Dinkey: Interesting.
(They explore and look at the alien stuff)

Fred Jones: Have you uh.. told the media about your experience, Lester?
Lester: Sure. Yeah, a number of times. But they think I'm some kind of nut!
Fred Jones: Uh-huh.
(Shaggy and Scooby open a closet door and an alien doll fell out, scaring them.)

Lester: Hey! Be careful with that!
Shaggy Rogers: Like, is this the kind of spaceship you went on?
Lester: Yep. Somethin' like that.
Fred Jones: But you said you have pictures.
Lester: You bet I do. Lots of pictures.
(He pulls the sheets off revealing the pictures we're actually paintings)

Daphne Blake: Oh, paintings.
Lester: Yep. I'm a landscape artist.
Daphne Blake: Uh, They're pretty nice, Lester.
Lester: Well, thank ye. Eh. Yeah, I been trying to show people the danger out there, but no one is believing me.
(Daphne sees the painting with a ship)

Daphne Blake: Hey. (picks it up) This looks like the ship we saw earlier.
Scooby-Doo: Reah.
Fred Jones: We don't even know we saw a ship.
Velma Dinkley: Well we know we saw something.
Daphne Blake: Lester, what are these?
Lester: SALF dishes. The government put them up about a year ago.
Daphne Blake: What are they for?
Lester: SALF means Search for Alien Life Forms.
Velma Dinkley: They send and monitor messages to and from space, hoping to find intelligent life.
Lester: Ever since they built them dishes, aliens started to show up. (Shaggy breaks the model ship) And I know why.
Fred Jones: Why?
Lester: TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!
(Scooby and Shaggy, try to fix the broken model spaceship, as Lest sees them, they hid it behind them.)

Fred Jones: I think Lester's has been painting in the sun too long.
Velma Dinkley: Maybe, but there may be a connection between those dishes and the aliens. I think we should investigate.
Lester: I got more pictures in the back room. You want to see 'em?
Fred Jones: No, thanks. Is there a hotel in this town?
Lester: There ain't no hotel. But you're welcome to stay here for the night.
Daphne Blake: You're very kind, but...
Lester: You ladies can sleep in the back room. Used to be the kids' 'til they moved out. And you, young fella can sleep on the couch.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, what about us?
Lester: Don't worry, I've got a place for you, too. But quit touching my stuff!
(Now we go to the rooftop we see Lester opens the door with his right arm while he's holding the blanket with his left arm as Shaggy and Scooby, climbs up)

Shaggy Rogers: Wow! It's pretty groovy up here!
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh.
Lester: Yep, it's nice ain't it. Now you boys get a good night rest.
(He threw the blanket with his right arm as it covers Shaggy and this also scares Scooby thinking Shaggy is a ghost as he removes the blanket)

Shaggy Rogers: Thanks Lest. (Notices Scooby) Oh, uh. Sorry Scoob.
(Now they went to sleep, until the aliens arrived)

(Later we see everyone sleeping, then we go to Shaggy and Scooby are sleeping when a spaceship appears above then and hooks comes to get them)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, uh, turn off the nightlight, Scoob.
(Then the claws got their beds, and take them aboard to the UFO and it flies off)

(Then we go inside the ship, where Shaggy and Scooby are still sleeping. Just then the shadowy figures showed up as Scooby wakes up to see the aliens)

(Scooby wakes and sees the aliens and go back to sleep)

Scooby-Doo: (wakes up) Huh?!
(Hé finally realizes they're in a spaeship)

Scooby-Doo: R-Raggy!
Shaggy Rogers: (sleeping) Not now, Scoob. I gladly accept the possesion of food critic for your magazine.
Scooby-Doo: SHAGGY!!
(Shaggy sees aliens beside him)

Shaggy Rogers: Aliens! (struggles) Hey! Let us, go! Like, we taste terrible. We're all stringy.
(Then one of the aliens puts his finger on Shaggy's head)

Scooby-Doo: Reah, ringy.
Alien #1: Do not fear us, Earth creatures.
Shaggy Rogers: Like it's too late for that, man.
(One of the aliens strips wire to Scooby)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, come on guys, don't you need to phone home or something?
(Shaggy laughed with the alien put a wire on his neck, and Scooby laughed along with him)

Alien #1: Cooperate and you will not be harmed.
(The aliens begin their experiments as Scooby uses his tail to reach the switch)

Alien #1: We'll be released of your questioning and physical examination.
Shaggy Rogers: Like sorry. But our health plans don't cover physicals.
(Scooby touches the switch and gets out of the rolling bed and then pushes the other where Shaggy is, They run around in circles while the aliens chased them in hot pursuit. They bump into one of the aliens as the other one tries to get Shaggy back but he and Scooby a tug of war who should get Shaggy and then spins around and then Shaggy crashes into the second one as he wakes up as sees him)

Shaggy Rogers: (Screams) A little help here, Scoob!
(The aliens begin to chase the two friends again, but then they crash into each other as they see three aliens, one of them brings out a gun made of laser which causes the two friends to get scared and faints as the screen turns black)

(The next day we see two silhouettes)

Woman: Hey man, are you like alright?
(Shaggy and Scooby woke up)

Shaggy Rogers: Like where are we?
Woman: Your out in the middle of nowhere, man. Oh, like what are you guys doing here?
Shaggy Rogers: Like hi.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, hello.
Woman: Hi, you okay?
Shaggy Rogers: Yeah, thanks.
Shaggy Rogers: You didn't see any... any...
Woman: Any what?
Shaggy Rogers: Uh, nevermind. Must've been a nightmare or something, eh, guys?
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh.
(Scooby to impress the dog, but she rejects her, and whips him with her tail)

Woman: Hey, you want some water?
Shaggy Rogers: Sure, thanks.
Woman: I'm like a freelance photographer. Amber and I are shooting some desert wildlife for a magazine.
Shaggy Rogers: Cool. Hey, we saw a jackalope last night.
Woman: A what?
Shaggy Rogers: You know, it's like a rabbit with antlers.
Woman: (Giggles) You are funny!
Scooby-Doo: Aliens, too!
Woman: Aliens?
Shaggy Rogers: You understand him?
Woman: Clear as crystal. Ha. That's my name too. I'm Crystal. Like what's your name?
Shaggy Rogers: Norville.
Crystal: Norville?
Shaggy Rogers: But like, everyone calls me, Shaggy. And that's Scooby-Doo.
Crystal: Wow, groovy names.
Shaggy Rogers: Groovy? Crystal, you're talking my lingo.
(As he shakes Crystal's hand)

(Then he stop shaking Crystal's hand)

Shaggy Rogers: Oh, sorry.
Crystal: So, can you show us where you saw the jackalopes and aliens?
Shaggy Rogers: I think so. But we've got to find out friends first
Crystal: Like, you guys want a lift.
Shaggy Rogers: Sure.
(Shaggy began to fall in fever love)

Shaggy Rogers: Scoob, old buddy, I don't know about you, but I think I just found my dream girl. 
Scooby-Doo: Me too.
(Crystal Honks the horn)

Crystal: Come on!
Shaggy Rogers: We're coming!
(As they got on the jeep, They took off)

Shaggy Rogers: You've got a groovy set of wheels, Crystal.
Crystal: Thanks.
(As he looks at the photography stuff)

Shaggy Rogers: Wow, you sure have a lot of stuff. 
Crystal: Like tell me about it. It's all my photography gear.
(Scooby places his arm on Amber, but she lift Scooby's arm away from her)

Shaggy Rogers: Hey. What's this?
Crystal: Oh, sorry, those are Amber's dog biscuits.
Shaggy Rogers: Mind if I take one?
Crystal: Sure, Scooby will love...
(Shaggy eats the dog biscuit)

Crystal: Oh... it's for you. (Laughs) You are a riot, man! (Laughs)
(As the jeep rides to the restaurant)

(Later at the diner)

Lester: So you think your friends are here already?
Daphne Blake: We can't of think of anyone else maybe.
(They went inside the diner)

Fred Jones: They could have at least just waited for us.
Daphne Blake: Well you know how those six get when there hungry.
(They see an empty chair)

Fred Jones: Huh? There not here.
Dottie: Good morning, y'all.
Everyone: Good morning.
Dottie: How did sleep last night dumbling? Did you dream about me?
Fred Jones: Did I dream about you... (laughs nerviously and then clears his throat)
Sergio: If you were in that dream it would be a nightmare.
Dottie: No one's talking to you, Serge!
Daphne Blake: Now where do you think those guys went?
Velma Dinkley: I think I know.
(The gang sees the two friends getting out of Crystal's jeep)

Daphne Blake: Who's that?
Lester: She's some sort of nature photographer, haven't been around since last week.
(Shaggy and Scooby walked in with loving joy, came in also)

Fred Jones: Hey, where are you guys been?
Daphne Blake: And who is that girl?
Shaggy Rogers: Her name's Crystal, she's wonderful.
Velma: And is her golden retriever "wonderful," too, Scooby?
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, Wonderful.
(The Girls giggled)

Dottie':' Okay, what's it gonna be? How about you, hon?
Shaggy Rogers: Nothing for me.
Scooby-Doo: Me either.
Velma and Daphne: (shocked) What?
Fred Jones: Are you guys serious?
Shaggy and Scooby: Yeah.
Velma Dinkley: I think they're seriously in L-O-V-E!
Lester: Just bring us four Ranch Breakfasts, Dottie.
Dottie':' You got it.
(She leaves to order the food as Shaggy begins to daydreaming as the song begins to play)

I met by chance
a girl in bell-bottom pants
and she likes to say
"Groovy"

She came out of the blue
And in an instant I knew
Everything would be
Groovy

For her, I'd climb a mountain
Swim the deepest ocean
I'd even help her shopping
That's the depth of my devotion

It will be
A dream come true
She's even got a doggy for Scooby-Doo!

How groovy
Just us two
So groovy
([Scooby:] Don't forget Scooby-Doo!)
Groovy
Our love will never be blue

I'll take this girl
On a tour of the world
Going port to port
(Groovy)

We'll spend all our time
Every single last dime
At the best food courts
Groovy!

Her smile's so bright it lights up
My romantic feelings
And best of all she's so tall
like, I won't have to reach for high things!

And even when
I'm chasing ghosts
I'll quit in time for dinner
Six o'clock at the most!

How groovy
Just us two
So groovy
([Scooby-Doo:] Don't forget Scooby Doo!)
Our love will never be blue

She'll cook me all my favorites
Six or seven helpings
And when it comes to say "I do"
We'll have a tie dye wedding

Our house will be
So very fine
We'll fill it up with stuff from 1969!

How groovy
Just us two
So groovy
And Shaggy Jr. too!
Groovy
And maybe some baby dogs, too
([Scooby:] Aww, heeheeheeheeheehee!)

How groovy (groovy)
So groovy (groovy)
How groovy

[Fade]

(In reality Shaggy and Scooby kiss each other instead as everyone laughs, and Shaggy and Scooby grossed out when that happened)

Daphne Blake: I said where did you meet them?
Shaggy Rogers: Who?
Daphne and Velma: Crystal and her dog.
Shaggy Rogers: Well they found us. Out in the middle of the desert.
Fred Jones: What we're you doing out there?
Shaggy Rogers: Oh yeah, I think Scoob and I we're abducted by aliens last night.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, aliens!
(Everyone was shocked)

Shaggy Rogers: Well yeah. Unless all of us have the same dream, it was horrible!
Dottie: Taste better than it looks son.
Lester: Did they experiment on you?
Shaggy Rogers: We don't remember!
(Scooby starts crying)

Sergio: I wonder why those kids are sticking around town.
Dottie':' Relax, Serge. They're just passing through, You're so suspicious.
(As Seigio looking the gangs very strange)

Fred Jones: I don't know guys. Are you sure, you didn't see a mirage or something?
Daphne Blake: Freddy, we all saw a spaceship.
Fred Jones: We don't know what that was. It could've been a new jet or something.
Shaggy Rogers: Well, we didn't just imagine what happened to us, Right, guys?
Scooby-Doo: Right, Shaggy!
Velma Dinkley: They didn't hurt you guys, did they?
Shaggy Rogers: I don't think so... then later we met Crystal and Amber.
Lester: Alien mind-control.
Velma Dinkley: Mind-control alright. But not alien.
Dottie':' See you at lunch, handsome.
Sergio: Hey, quit scaring the customers!
Dottie: Shut it, Serge! You have a nice day now.
(As they leave the Diner and Lester leaves)

Daphne and Velma: See you later, Lester.
Fred Jones: Where's Scooby and Shaggy?
Velma Dinkley: They're still in the restroom.
Fred Jones: Still?
Daphne Blake: Oh, here they come.
(As Scooby and Shaggy comes out of the diner with a new look)

Daphne Blake: Wow, this is a new look.
Fred Jones: Yeah, you look, uh... different.
Velma Dinkley: I've never seen you with your hair combed or your shirt tucked in.
Shaggy Rogers: Just thought, we'd freshed up a bit. Right pal?
Scooby-Doo: That's right.
Daphne Blake: Well, you do look very refreshed, Scooby.
(The Girls giggled)

Fred Jones: Come on, let's find a service station and get our van fixed.
(As the gangs goes to the garage)

Fred Jones: What's that smell?
Shaggy Rogers: Oh, just some cologne they had in the restroom.
(At Buck's Garage)

Fred Jones: Hello?
Buck: What you need?
Fred Jones: Hi. I was wondering if you had time to fix our van, It's stuck out in-
Buck: I'm busy.
Fred Jones: Oh, well uh, Maybe if you could-
Buck: I already saw your van out by Scorpion Ridge, Your radiator's shot.
Fred Jones: Yeah.
Buck: What were you doing out there, anyway?
Daphne Blake: We got lost in a dust-
Buck: I'll tow it in and work on it when I can.
(As he continues fixing it)

Fred Jones: Uh, Great, Thanks.
(As they leave)

Velma Dinkley: Yeah. He's a real Prince Charming.
(Then SALF Van appears)

Max: Hey, there.
Everyone: Hello.
Max: You folks own that green van outside of town?
Daphne Blake: Boy, everyone seems to know about our car troubles.
Max: It's a pretty small town, Besides, you can see that paint job from miles away.
Fred Jones: I guess you're right. So you work on those dishes?
Max: Yep, the name's Max. I work at the station. (Shakes Fred's hand) We're monitoring the cosmos twenty-four hours a day seven days a week.
Fred Jones: I'm Fred, and this is Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby.
Max: Nice to meet you all.
Velma Dinkley: Your work sounds interesting.
Max: Actually is pretty boring. Most of the time we just listen to static.
Daphne Blake: Do you ever make contact?
Max: (Laughs) Not yet, but we're hoping.
Velma DInkley: Have you ever give people tours?
Max: Uh... no one's ever asked, but I be happy to show you around.
Velma Dinkley: Great!
Max: We never get visitors. And let me pick up some oils here and I'll drive you over.
Fred Jones: Need any help?
Max: Sure thing.
(The gangs already pack a pack of oil in the van)

Fred Jones: That's a lot of oil, Max.
Max: Yeah the radio dishes take up a lot.
Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks! I got oil on my shirt!
(As Shaggy try to rub the oil of his shirt, Scooby gives the napkin to Shaggy)

Scooby-Doo: Here Shaggy!
(As Shaggy uses a napkin to get rid of the oil)

Fred Jones: Oh, brother.
(The girls giggled, Then the Jeep arrived and Crystal and Amber appeared)

Crystal: Hey! You guys ready to see a Jackalope?
Shaggy Rogers: Sure thing, Crystal.
Daphne and Velma: Jackalope?
(As Shaggy and Scooby get on the Jeep)

Shaggy Rogers: Scooby and I are gonna hang with them for a while, Catch you guys later.
(Scooby giggles, Then the Jeep took off)

Velma Dinkley: They say there's someone out there for everyone.
Daphne Blake: Even Shaggy and Scooby!
(As the SALF Van starts and gangs get on the van and drives off, Then Buck sees the gangs have toke off to the desert)

(At the Desert, While Shaggy and Crystal are having a nice conversation, Scooby and Amber looks at the Pretty Flowers)

Shaggy Rogers: Well, this is about where Scoob and I first saw the big jackalope.
Crystal: Now it's "the big jackalope."
(Then we go to the flower field, Where Scooby picks up flowers for Amber, And give her flowers to Amber and licks Scooby's Face)

Scooby-Doo: Scooby Dooby Doo!
(As Crystal Giggles, Scooby does his tricks, Then he found a Roses of Cactus, As Shaggy picks up Flowers and a Spider, She takes a picture of flowers, Then Shaggy arrives, But the a Spider appears causing to go into Shaggy's Shirt, and starts freaking out As Shaggy starts panicing to get rid of the spider, Then hé stops for a moment, Then Shaggy gives a flower to Crystal)

Crystal: You are one funny cat, Shaggy. Where did you say you saw this giant jackalope?
Scooby-Doo: Over there.
(Then they saw an Electric fence with a hole, As Amber goes into a hole and Crystal climbs up the Electric Fence)

Shaggy Rogers: You're going in there?
Crystal: Yeah. Come on, Shaggy. I want a shot of that jackalope.
Shaggy Rogers: But that's where we saw the aliens.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah! Aliens!
Crystal: The big aliens?
Shaggy Rogers: As a matter of fact, they were. I don't think we should...
Crystal: Please?
Shaggy Rogers: Come on, old buddy. The girls need us.
Scooby-Doo: Okay!
(As Shaggy climbs up and jumps over the Electrice fence, Then Scooby goes into the hole without getting electrocuted)

Crystal: All right!
(At the SALF headquarters)

Laura: We collect signals from dozens of stars a week.It's all channeled through here where the data is recorded.
Steve: It's the biggest collection of static in the US!
Laura: Steve thinks it's boring work.
Max: And he's right!
Steve: But if there's even a tiny chance of making contact with alien intelligence...it'll be worth a truckload of boredom.
Fred Jones: Well, The locals seem to think aliens are being attracted by your dishes.
Laura: That's ridiculous. They forget to lock their corrals at night...and try to blame aliens for their missing livestock.
Steve: The government even sent an investigation team to look into this "alien presence."
Max: Yeah, they're the ones who put up that fence at Scorpion Ridge.
Velma Dinkley: What are they doing in there?
Steve: Who knows? Wasting government money.
Laura: Unlike us?
(Steve, Max and Laura laughs)

Steve: So, what brings you to town?
(Velma takes a looks seeing dirt on their shoes)

Fred Jones: Car trouble. We got lost and bagnes up our van.
Max: That's too bad. But Buck is a good mechanic. He'll have you out of here in no time.
Laura: Where's your other friend and his dog?
Daphne Blake: On a date.
(At the desert, Crystal took a picture of the lizard a sit runs off)

Amber: (Barking)
Crystal: Like this place is so beautiful.
Shaggy Rogers: I'll say.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah. Beautiful.
Crystal: Thanks for bringing us. Even though we didn't see any jackalopes.
Shaggy Rogers: Sure, Crystal. So like, I was wondering...if you had a boyfriend.

Shaggy Rogers: What for?
Crystal: Shaggy, I have a confession to make.
Shaggy Rogers: You got a boyfriend?
Crystal: No, nothing like that. I'm not really a nature photographer.
Scooby-Doo: You're not?
Crystal: No. I'm really a government agent. I was sent by the government to investigate alien sightings in this area.
Shaggy Rogers: I knew this was too good to be true.
Crystal: We need your help. I hope this doesn't change anything between us. Amber is a government trained canine, Scooby. Is that all right?
Scooby-Doo: Huh-uh.
Crystal: Then you guys will help us? You guys are the coolest! (She hugs Shaggy)
(Amber licks Scooby, Back at SALF Headquaters)

(The gang gets inside Lester's truck and takes off)

Fred Jones: They sure were nice back there.
Daphne Blake: I don't know if I could do a job like that, day in and day out.
Velma Dinkley: Maybe they can't either.
Fred Jones: What are you talking about?
Velma Dinkley: Did you notice that they all had dried mud on their shoes?
Daphne Blake: Come to think of it, yeah.
Fred Jones: Yeah. So?
Velma Dinkley: Where would there be mud around here? Especially if you work in that clean facility all day and night.
Fred Jones: Good point.
Velma Dinkley: And all that motor oil Max said was for the SALF dishes...It's the wrong kind for hydraulics.
Fred Jones: Hey, that's right.
Daphne Blake: Do you think they're up to something?
Lester: I'd bet my teeth on it!
Steve: Looks like they're headed for Scorpion Ridge.
Laura: I wonder what they're looking for.
Steve: You'd better call it in.
Max: Right. (Picks up his Walkie-Talkie)
(Now we go to the électrice fence, Where Shaggy, Scooby, Crystal, and Amber are walking to the flower field)

Buck: No. I'll get to it this afternoon.
Daphne Blake: Okay. We'd sure appreciate it. Thank you.
(The gang leaves)

Fred Jones: I think he was much nicer this time.
Daphne Blake: What is he doing out here?
Velma Dinkley: I don't know, but he sure is suspicious.

Lester: No problem.
(Lester leaves)

Daphne and Velma: Bye.
Fred Jones: Did you notice the green paint on Lester's hands?
Daphne Blake: Well, he is a painter, Freddy. Why did you want him to drop us off here?
Velma Dinkley: I think those SALF scientists were near water.
Fred Jones: Because they had dried mud on their shoes, right?
Velma Dinkley Right, and the only place I think that would have mud is the gorge.There might be a river at the bottom.
Fred Jones: What are we waiting for? Let's go.
(Cut to the four)

Crystal: I think I see something ahead.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, the exit, I hope. (Sees the glow) That's the glow we saw last night. Right before the aliens!

(Shaggy sees the aliens and screams in terror The four runs for their lives as the song "The Aliens are Hère" plays)

They're here from outer space
They're knocking ta the door
Are they here for a party, or do they want more?
Watch out! We're not alone
I wish they'd just phone home

The aliens are here
To get the human race
The aliens are here
We've gotta get out of this place
The aliens are here

They're icky, bug-eyed beings from outer space
Ugly, green and slimy all over the place
Who knows just what they'll do?
If they grab you, say toodle-oo, dude

The aliens are here
They're out in force tonight
The aliens are here
We better keep out of théir sight
The aliens are here

If they catch you on their ship, they'll expérimenté on you
And turn you into something for their interstellar zoo, dude!
Beware, you better hide!
They're closing in on every side! Oh, no!

The aliens are here
They're dropping in our face
The aliens are here
We gotta get outta this place
The aliens are here
The aliens are here

Alien #1: Silence, earthlings! You should not have interfered.

Velma Dinkley: You can give up the hokey alien charade now, Steve.

(The aliens were surprised and one of the aliens takes off the mask, revealing to be Steve)

Steve: You figured it out, uh?

Velma Dinkley Wasn't hard.

(Then The two aliens unmasked thèmselves, revealing to be Laura and Max)

Steve: Well, it doesn't matter now.

Daphne Blake: Why would scientists like you do this?

Laura: Are you kidding? Do you have any idea how much gold is down here?

Velma Dinkley: You three give scientists a bad name. You should be doing your jobs instead of looking for gold.

Max: I was doing my job when I stumbled onto this mine.

Fred Jones: What do you mean?

Max: Well, you'll see. 

(Flashback stars)

Max (V.O.): One day I was looking for a site to place a fourth SALF dish...at the east end of Scorpion Ridge...when I stumbled on an opening to a small cave.

(Max steps on a small hole hidden behind the bushes. Now we go to him grabs on the rope and slides Down insiste the cave)

(Steve and Laura slides down inside the cave as they explore everything and then they see something was gold) 

Max (V.O.): I'm sure you can guess what we found. The mother of all mother lodes!

Laura (V.O.): And best of all, no one knew about it but the three of us.

(Flashback ends)

Velma Dinkley: But I still don't see how you could have dug all this out.

Steve: Ha, we didn't. This was a mine in the 1800s. It was abandoned when the miners thought it was all played out.

Laura: If they'd have dug ten more feet,they would have discovered all this gold.

(Flashback starts)

Steve (V.O.): Their loss is our gain. 

Max (V.O.): We found that these caverns run from Scorpion Ridge to the SALF Station.

Laura (V.O.): But since all this property belongs to the government...

(Flashback ends)

Max: We decided to mine it for ourselves and not report it.

Laura: We hired two friends to help us fence off the area as government property.

Velma Dinkley: The fake MPs?

Steve: Exactly! They guard the area while we mine the caves in shifts.

Velma Dinkley: And you keep your easy jobs at the SALF Station.

Steve: You're pretty smart, Velma. Too bad you've made your last deduction.

Shaggy Rogers: I'll say. Where are we anyway?

(As Scooby and Amber wonders and looks around the deeper cave)

Scooby-Doo: Yikes!

(They run to them but they stopped when they almost fall down the edge)

Shaggy Rogers: ZOINKS!!!

(Echoing)

Fred Jones: So what's with the alien costumes?

Steve: Something to scare the locals so they don't come snooping around.

Laura: It also explains the mysterious sounds of our drilling and blasting.
