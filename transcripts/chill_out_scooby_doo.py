(The film opens to the Himalayas as the title reads "Chill Out, Scooby-Doo!" The credits roll and then we got to the mountain, where two men walking, and one man sees something)

Man 1: (gasps) Look.
Man 2: Egads.
(They see a statue that has a carving)

Man 1: See, professor? The ancient carvings, just as I promised you.
Professor Jeffries: So the legend is true.
(The professor examines the carving, and takes out the manuscript, that compares the carving on the statue)

Professor Jeffries: Yes. It's all here, just as the manuscript describes. I've found it at last. Come, Pemba. The lost kingdom of Shangri-la awaits.
(He goes further to the way, but Pemba stops him.)

Professor Jeffries: What?
Pemba: I am sorry, professor. We dare not go further. These lands are forbidden.
Professor Jeffries: Forbidden? By whom? Look around. We're the only ones here.
(Pemba sees a couple of footprints)

Pemba: No we are not alone.
(Then, they hear a menacing roar, and the snowstorm comes)

Pemba: We should not be here. He is coming.
(He runs but the professor stops him)

Professor Jeffries: No, Pemba. We can't quit now, not when we're so close.
Pemba: You do not understand. We must hurry.
Professor Jeffries: (gets out his pocket knife) Then I'll go alone.
(Then, the professor cuts the robe)

Pemba: Wait! Professor! Professor!
(The professor wouldn’t listen, and disappears in the cloud of snow. as Pemba goes to find him, he sees the creature roared at him.)

Pemba: No!
(He runs but the floor cracked and Pemba falls and slides down the mountain, then he gets out his pickaxe, and finally stops before he falls off the cliff and then sees the monster climb up the mountain and dissappears in the cloud of snow)

Pemba: I have seen the creature.
(We fade to the view of the mountain)

Scene 2
(Then, we go to Paris)

Daphne Blake: Don't you just love Paris? The city, the sights, the shopping. Isn't it romantic, Freddie?
Fred Jones: Oh, man, I think I'm in love. (His attention is at a phone) This new cell phone rocks. It's got hi-def video, an MP3 player, even satellite GPS. I'm, like, totally geeking.
Velma Dinkley: Really? How can you tell?
Daphne Blake: I don't know which is worse: Fred and his phone, or you and your newspapers. I thought we were supposed to be on vacation.
Velma Dinkley: We are. You know how I like reading in a foreign language. Listen to this, gang. Climbers on Mount Everest claim to have seen the abominable snowman, a mysterious creature believed to exist in the high Himalayas.
Daphne Blake: Oh no. Not this time Velma. I don’t care if this is in French or Swahili. There will be no mysteries on this trip. Do you hear me!?
Velma Dinkley: I hear you. Can I have my cheeks back?
Fred Jones: Speaking of mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were supposed to meet us here over an hour ago. Where can they be?
Daphne Blake: Knowing those two, they've probably been sidetracked by their stomachs.
(Later on a plane we Shaggy and Scooby eating)

Scooby-Doo: Yummy.
Shaggy Rogers: What a great idea, Scoob. Like, I've always wanted to fly an all-you-can-eat airline.
Scooby-Doo: Yeah, me too.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, gee whiz. Shouldn't we have landed in Paris by now?
(???)

Pilot: We're coming up on the drop zone. Mount Everest, dead ahead.
???: Mount Everest, tallest mountain in the world, and home to the abominable snowman.
Pilot: So you're really going through with this?
???: But of course. I am Alphonse Lafleur, the world's greatest hunter. Now, I come in search of the world's greatest prize.
Pilot: But I thought the abominable snowman is just a myth. How do you catch a monster that may not even exist?
Alphonse LaFleur: Oh, mu flaire, With a bait no monster can resist.
(Then the cabin alarm is sounded)

Alphonse LaFleur: Sacré bleu! What can they want now?
(Scooby is ringing the button)

Scooby-Doo: Hello, anybody home? Hello?
Alphonse LaFleur: Bonjour mis amis and thank you for flying Alphonse Lafleur's Le Monde Grande Tours. We are going to be landing very shortly.
Shaggy Rogers: Boy, are we glad to hear that. Like, my stomach is already coming in for a three-snack landing.
Alphonse LaFleur: You have eaten everything?
Shaggy Rogers: Almost. Like, I'm still saving the last slice of peanut butter and pineapple pizza, in case of an emergency.
(???)

Shaggy Rogers: Hey.
Alphonse LaFleur: The pooch is still hungry, no? We have lots of yummy goodies waiting for you in the VIP lounge.
(It wasn’t the VIP lounge it was a cargo area)

Shaggy Rogers: This is the VIP lounge?
Alphonse LaFleur: You are on the package tour, no? (closes the box with them inside)
Shaggy Rogers: I didn't know that that meant we were the package.
(???)

Shaggy Rogers: You said it, Scoob. Like, I think we've just been bumped from first class to worst class.
(???)

Alphonse LaFleur: ???
(???)

Shaggy Rogers: Zoinks, like, now, we know how it feels to be lost luggage.
(Then a ringing sound is heard)

Shaggy Rogers: As if things weren't bad enough, now my ears are ringing.
Scooby-Doo: Shaggy, cell phone. Cell phone.
Shaggy Rogers: Hey, my cell phone.
Shaggy Rogers: (answers his phone) Like, world's worst vacation ever, Shaggy speaking.
(???)

Fred Jones: Shaggy? I can barely hear you. Where are you guys?
Shaggy Rogers: Hang on, Freddie. Like, I think Scoob and I are about to go from frequent fliers to frequent criers.
(???)

Fred Jones: Shaggy? Scooby? I've lost their signal.
Daphne Blake: Can't you trace it with that high-tech GPS thingy?
Fred Jones: Oh, yeah. With global positioning, I should be able to pinpoint their exact location. (attivates GPS on his phone) Just a little satellite tracking, and viola! (sees that the signal came from the Himalayas) Wait, this can't be right.
Fred Jones: Look.
Velma and Daphne: The Himalayas?
Velma Dinkley: Home to Mount Everest. And the headline-making mystery of the abominable snowman.
Daphne Blake: Now, hold on. Just because there's a mysterious monster on the loose, it doesn't necessarily mean that Shaggy and Scooby are going to get in trouble. Does it?
Fred Jones: We've got to get to Mount Everest. Everybody in the van.
Velma Dinkley: Sorry, Daphne, but it looks like you're trading in your new heels for snowshoes.
Daphne Blake: Oh, just once, I'd like to have a vacation that stays a vacation. Like, elevator going down.
(They head to the Mystery Machine)

Scene 3
(At a village, the villagers are leaving, as we got the temple and fire)

Professor Jeffries: I'm very sorry, Pemba. I don't know what came over me. I should never have cut that rope. Without you, I quickly became lost, and wondered in the blinding snowstorm for hours. I barely made it back here alive.
Pemba: It is my own fault, professor. I should not have taken you as far as the forbidden lands.
Professor Jeffries: But you did, Pemba. And now the discovery of a lifetime is still within our grasp. The lost kingdom of Shangri-la, hidden from mankind for centuries. Why, it's an archeologist's dream. And it's right up there, just waiting for me. I mean, for us, of course. It's waiting for us.
Pemba: You may be right, but you forget. Something else is waiting there too.
Professor Jeffries: Don't you see? The abominable snowman must be guarding the secret entrance. That's how close we are.
Pemba: No. You do not understand. We have angered the creature, and now he will seek his revenge. That is why everyone is fleeing the village.
Professor Jeffries: Not everyone, it seems.
(A woman shows up with warm drinks)

Pemba: Minga. What are you doing here?
Minga Sherpa: I've brought you some hot tea.
Pemba: No, I mean...
(He takes out the headphones)

Minga Sherpa: Hey, I'm listening to that.
Pemba: Why are you still in the village? You should be leaving with the others.
Minga Sherpa: I'm not a little girl anymore, Pemba. You can stop trying to frighten me with your monster stories now.
Pemba: Please excuse my sister, professor. She is as stubborn as a yak.
Professor Jeffries: So, Minga, you don't believe in the abominable snowman?
Minga Sherpa: When I was younger, Pemba used to try to scare me. "The yeti is going to get you." Now he's going around telling everyone that he's actually seen the creature.
Pemba: I am not kidding this time. The yeti is real.
(???)

Shaggy Rogers: We may be freezing cold, but we're coming in hot.
(???)

Pemba: Egads. Are you all right?
Professor Jeffries: Did you break anything?
The High Lama: What is this intrusion?
Pemba: I humbly apologize, most high lama, but...
The High Lama: The monastery is closed. Now, go away.
Pemba: But look. A couple of strangers have fallen from the sky.
(???)

The High Lama: Indeed.
(???)

The High Lama: May I offer you something warm to drink? You must be very cold and tired after your long journey, huh?
Shaggy Rogers: Like, you had us at "warm."
(They drink the warm tea, but they found it disgusting)

Tara Duncan: Yuck! What is this?
The High Lama: I see you do not enjoy our yak-butter tea.
Shaggy Rogers: Well, I'll say one thing. You can really taste the yak.
Scooby-Doo: Yuck!
Shaggy Rogers: Do you mind if we use your phone? Our friends must think we've totally flaked on them. Like, snow-flaked, that is.
Scooby-Doo: Oh, brother.
The High Lama: I am sorry, but we have no such modern conveniences here.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, wherever here is.
(Scooby grabs a mallets and hits the gong so hard he shakes and heads to a door he gets ups and sees a picture of a monster)

Scooby-Doo: Yikes, Shaggy!
(He jumps to Shaggy's arms)

Scooby-Doo: Monster. Monster.
Shaggy Rogers: That's no monster, Scooby-Doo. It's just some kind of creepy carving.
Scooby-Doo: Uh?
The High Lama: You have discovered our most sacred chamber.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, way to go, Scoob. Why couldn't you discover something useful like the refrigerator?
Scooby-Doo: Sorry.
(They head into the chamber)

The High Lama: In this chamber, we offer sacrifices to the yeti. Half man and half animal, he lives in the snow caves, high on the mountain.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, there goes the neighborhood.
Professor Jeffries: What an extraordinary crystal. May I examine it, closer?
The High Lama: No, you may not.
(He back everyone out of the chamber)

The High Lama: The crystal is sacred. Its mystical glow protects us from the creature's evil power.
Shaggy and Scooby: (gulps And frightened) Evil power?
(???)

Alphonse LaFleur: Bonjour mis amis. I have found you.
Shaggy Rogers: Look out, Scoob. It’s that terrible tour guide!
(???)

The High Lama: Do you know this man?
Shaggy Rogers: Yeah. And like thanks to him, a great tour took a grand detour.
Alphonse LaFleur: My sincerest apologies. There was a terrible mishap. I was so worried, that I jumped out of the plane myself desperate to save you.
Shaggy Rogers: Speaking of desperate, what about the rest of the gang? They must be worried sick about us. We're very popular, you know.
Scooby-Doo: Uh-huh.
Minga Sherpa: I know. Why don't you try calling your friends from the weather station?
Shaggy Rogers: Weather station, eh? Well, what are we waiting for?
(They get down)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, hook us up with that satellite hookup.
Minga Sherpa: It is a bit further up the mountain. I can take you there.
Pemba Sherpa: The only place you are going is down the mountain. I would be honored to guide you to the weather station.
Professor Jeffries: I'll go too. With that snow creature out there, we'll have greater strength in numbers.
Alphonse LaFleur: Oui monsieur, we will all climb the mountain together.
The High Lama: Beware, gentlemen. The yeti is the watcher of the guarded places, a realm of terrible danger where those who seek the unknown meet their doom.
(He disappears as the folks look scared)

Shaggy Rogers: Like, whatever happened to "bon voyage"?
Scooby-Doo: Yeah.
(We fade to the others)

Daphne Blake: Admit it, Freddie. We're lost.
Fred Jones: We're not lost. We're just taking a shortcut.
Daphne Blake: Across Mongolia?
Fred Jones: Just keep an eye out for road signs to Timbuktu. So, Velma, what can you tell us about this abdominal snowman?
Velma Dinkley: Not "abdominal," Freddie. It's pronounced abominable.
(Fred tries to pronounce the word, but fails to do it)

Velma Dinkley: There are a number of different theories regarding the abominable snowman. And there have been many photographs taken of the yeti's footprints.
Daphne Blake: Hold it. Back up. Yeti footprints? What on earth is a yeti?
Velma Dinkley: The yeti is the name used by the local mountain people to describe the creature.
Fred Jones: So the yeti and the subliminal snowman are the same thing?
Velma Dinkley: Not "subliminal," Fred. (Velma tries to pronounce the word, but fails to do it, as the other laugh) Now you've got me all mixed up.
Fred Jones: I don't understand. What does any of this have to do with Shaggy and Scooby?
Daphne Blake: There's no mystery there, Carver. One thing we know for sure, those two always know how to find trouble.
(They continued driving)

Scene TBA
Del Chillman: All aboard the snowman express!
Professor Jeffries: You're not out of this race you Jeffries old boy.
Scene 14
(We fade to Paris, Del speak French to Minga)

Minga Sherpa: Oh, I am loving the Paris.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, us too. They say Paris is for lovers, right, Scoob? Well, I'm in love with this springtime spread.
Scooby-Doo: Oui, oui, Shaggy.
(He grabs a cream filled donut and takes a bite but it’s squirts out the cramfiled and hits Shaggy’s face and Scooby licks him)

Daphne Blake: Where's Freddie? He was supposed to meet us here an hour ago.
Shaggy Rogers: Can you believe it, Scoob? My ears are ringing again. (Scooby brings the phone)
Scooby-Doo: It's your phone.
Shaggy Rogers: Like, hello.
(We cut to Fred in the Amazon jungle)

Fred Jones: Uh, Guys? I think I got on the wrong plane.
(Then the heroes run to the Mystery Machine)

Velma Dinkley: Here we go again.
Daphne Blake: (Moans) Now where?
Shaggy Rogers: Like, step on it, Scoob. Next stop, the Amazon jungle.
(Scooby hits the gas pedal as the Mystery Machine drives off)

Scooby-Doo: Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
