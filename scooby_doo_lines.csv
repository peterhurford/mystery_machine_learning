Fred Jones,trying to attack you
Fred Jones,come on guys we better get of here before these mysterious mischievous makers try to taught themselves
Fred Jones,yes butll be more productive if we first get all our facts straight
Fred Jones,i think the village is being terrorized for a reason somebody wants him to scare everyone off and get us out of the way
Fred Jones,if the oteros are forced to sale señor fuente gets what he wants the oteros land
Fred Jones,the footprints leading away from the cottage suggested el chupacabra was scared off when shaggy alerted the rest of us
Fred Jones,yeah theyre anticipating our every move but how
Fred Jones,wait freeze that frame look whoever wrote mañana a spanish word for tomorrow forgot the tilde
Fred Jones,its a symbol you put over the n to change the pronunciation without it the word would be said as manana instead of mañana a mistake no real spanish speaking person would ever make

Fred Jones,maybe but theres always the possibility theres more than one bad guy
Fred Jones,can i see your medallion just as i thought its a tracking device lets see if it works in reverse
Fred Jones,cant you see many of them dont understand your foreign language speaking spanish might help

Daphne Blake,i dont we can roll out the supernatural
Daphne Blake,if the creatures at the pyramids were special affects they were pretty special
Daphne Blake,velma did you save the torn label from the fake warriors costume
Daphne Blake,officers
Daphne Blake,so he terrorize the tourists with the chupachapra attacks hoping to ruin the oteros hotel business and force them to sell
Daphne Blake,and by kidnapping me and framing us as vandals he was able to derail our investigation and create bad publicity for the pyramids
Daphne Blake,it sure doesnt look like a special effect to me
Daphne Blake,hardly it takes two to tango
Daphne Blake,so guess there never was a real chupacabra i wonder how that myth got started

Velma Dinkley,heres what were going to do
Velma Dinkley,help me i have fallen and i cant get up now yes you did it guys
Velma Dinkley,maybe i can explain i found flash powder residue where shag and scoob saw the ghost this is the device to throw the fireballs which was just watts of flash paper he got it from his daughters stage prompts
Velma Dinkley,its the cherry picker that made the ghost flie above the trees with the use of an extention device and theres the fan that created the eerie wind it took more than one person to pull of this scam isnt that right jack
Velma Dinkley,it would take someone pretty strong to hoist mr mcnight around
Velma Dinkley,that goes for all of you
Velma Dinkley,sure there had to be more people involved to make this hoax work
Velma Dinkley,shaggy you still have the shoe buckel scooby found today
