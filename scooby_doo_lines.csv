Velma Dinkley,and griswald disgruntled archaeologists from the museums babylonian project they were upset with you for cutting their funding dr dean
Velma Dinkley,mr ravencroft i am a huge fan of your work i have read all your books in which my opinion are the best horror stories ever written
Velma Dinkley,ben ravencroft: thanks velma
Velma Dinkley,you know my name
Velma Dinkley,oh please what we do pales in comparation with the sheer ponderable fright of your novels
Velma Dinkley,i mean take the dead mole for example; oh that creepy jewerly store owner was an incredibly complex character
Velma Dinkley,ben ravencroft: youre very kind listen velma im going back to my hometown in massachusetts this weekend to the house where i work my early book i go back every year for the fall color its very peaceful and relaxing why dont you and your friends come visit
Velma Dinkley,really oh that would be great uh wouldnt it gang
Velma Dinkley,and that scene at the end where the caretakers flesh dissolved was so brilliant i
Velma Dinkley,already
Velma Dinkley,i thought you said this was a quiet little town
Velma Dinkley,jinkies looks like you got a ghost in your own backyard ben
Velma Dinkley,this is amazing mayor
Velma Dinkley,so you say a ghost has been appearing here
Velma Dinkley,just like the salem witch trials many men and women who were a bit different or didnt conform to the codes of the colony suffer the same fate
Velma Dinkley,wow would we ever shaggy well meet up with you later
Velma Dinkley,wow so this is where it all started
Velma Dinkley,ben ravencroft: yes i wrote all my early novels here now i spend must of my time in europe but i come back once a year to recharge my batteries go ahead velma sit down
Velma Dinkley,jinkies this is a dream come true
Velma Dinkley,id reed about them wiccans were people who were in turned with the forces of nature and use them for healing purposes
Velma Dinkley,hey i saw a huge oak tree like that in the town square
Velma Dinkley,wiccans have been misunderstood accused of sorcery in fact the word witch comes from wicca
Velma Dinkley,ben ravencroft: im impressed velma you know doing research on sarah and the wiccans lead me to read almost everything about the world of supersation thats how i started writing stories to frighten people
Velma Dinkley,is there anything left in the kitchen
Velma Dinkley,bens already gone ahead
Velma Dinkley,whats going on guys
Velma Dinkley,ben ravencroft: a roast
Velma Dinkley,you saw the witchs ghost
Velma Dinkley,hmm you said she threw fire balls right
Velma Dinkley,shaggy rogers: it was like this velma but a thousand times worse
Velma Dinkley,is this the street she chased you guys
Velma Dinkley,this is getting interesting ben
Velma Dinkley,lets go see
Velma Dinkley,fred jones: geez all those explosions at the end are mystifying eh velma
Velma Dinkley,yeah very mystifying
Velma Dinkley,ill say
Velma Dinkley,gee why is it that you always pair off with daphne fred
Velma Dinkley,fred jones: uh well
Velma Dinkley,never mind it is a good idea you guys stay here we wanna take another look at where the guys saw that ghost
Velma Dinkley,come on
Velma Dinkley,lets take a look behind these trees

Velma Dinkley,right lets see where these tracks lead
Velma Dinkley,shh
Velma Dinkley,jinkies its the mayor
Velma Dinkley,i dont know but were going to find out whats in that barn
Velma Dinkley,fine you check the barn and well follow the mayor
Velma Dinkley,theres gotta be another way in here

Velma Dinkley,velma & ben: sorry
Velma Dinkley,velma & ben: sorry
Velma Dinkley,thats no mystery
Velma Dinkley,he did there goes my cherry picker theory
Velma Dinkley,like what
Velma Dinkley,sorry about that mayor scooby and shaggy just lose it when they get scared in fact im worried that staying in oakhaven might just be too frightening and experienced for them i think we should leave
Velma Dinkley,but i need to get one more clue before the night is over then i think ill can solve the mystery of the witchs ghost before tomorrows autumns fest
Velma Dinkley,daphne blake: what was that all about velma
Velma Dinkley,heres what were going to do
Velma Dinkley,help me i have fallen and i cant get up now yes you did it guys
Velma Dinkley,maybe i can explain i found flash powder residue where shag and scoob saw the ghost this is the device to throw the fireballs which was just watts of flash paper he got it from his daughters stage prompts
Velma Dinkley,its the cherry picker that made the ghost flie above the trees with the use of an extention device and theres the fan that created the eerie wind it took more than one person to pull of this scam isnt that right jack
Velma Dinkley,it would take someone pretty strong to hoist mr mcnight around
Velma Dinkley,that goes for all of you
Velma Dinkley,sure there had to be more people involved to make this hoax work
Velma Dinkley,shaggy you still have the shoe buckel scooby found today
Velma Dinkley,scooby can you show me exactly where you found this
Velma Dinkley,right i believe this is was left of the tree where sarah did her healing you never even noticed it because it was cut down hundreds of years ago its up to you to dig it scooby
Velma Dinkley,then how about a scooby snax
Velma Dinkley,two scooby snax
Velma Dinkley,the box
Velma Dinkley,ben that doesnt seem to be a journal at all
Velma Dinkley,ben ravencroft: because it isnt velma its a spell book
Velma Dinkley,you lied to me ben
Velma Dinkley,ben ravencroft: well gee i have to id been searching for years then i read about your exploits i knew if anyone can help me find the book it was you and your friends i orchestrated the whole mummy scheme paying off the archaeologists and the security guards just to lure you to the museum so we can met yes velma i tricked you into helping me and it worked
Velma Dinkley,i know why because if we know what that book was we would never have helped him
Velma Dinkley,no
Velma Dinkley,ben please stop
Velma Dinkley,no
Velma Dinkley,ben ravencroft: whats the matter velma dont you like the new and improved ben ravencroft
