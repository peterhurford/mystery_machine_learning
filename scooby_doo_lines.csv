Velma Dinkley,i dont believe it youre ben ravencroft the famous horror writter
Velma Dinkley,and griswald disgruntled archaeologists from the museums babylonian project they were upset with you for cutting their funding dr dean
Velma Dinkley,mr ravencroft i am a huge fan of your work i have read all your books in which my opinion are the best horror stories ever written
Velma Dinkley,you know my name
Velma Dinkley,oh please what we do pales in comparation with the sheer ponderable fright of your novels
Velma Dinkley,i mean take the dead mole for example; oh that creepy jewerly store owner was an incredibly complex character
Velma Dinkley,really oh that would be great uh wouldnt it gang
Velma Dinkley,and that scene at the end where the caretakers flesh dissolved was so brilliant i
Velma Dinkley,already
Velma Dinkley,i thought you said this was a quiet little town
Velma Dinkley,jinkies looks like you got a ghost in your own backyard ben
Velma Dinkley,this is amazing mayor
Velma Dinkley,so you say a ghost has been appearing here
Velma Dinkley,just like the salem witch trials many men and women who were a bit different or didnt conform to the codes of the colony suffer the same fate
Velma Dinkley,wow would we ever shaggy well meet up with you later
Velma Dinkley,wow so this is where it all started
Velma Dinkley,jinkies this is a dream come true
Velma Dinkley,id reed about them wiccans were people who were in turned with the forces of nature and use them for healing purposes
Velma Dinkley,hey i saw a huge oak tree like that in the town square
Velma Dinkley,wiccans have been misunderstood accused of sorcery in fact the word witch comes from wicca
Velma Dinkley,is there anything left in the kitchen
Velma Dinkley,bens already gone ahead
Velma Dinkley,whats going on guys
Velma Dinkley,you saw the witchs ghost
Velma Dinkley,hmm you said she threw fire balls right
Velma Dinkley,is this the street she chased you guys
Velma Dinkley,this is getting interesting ben
Velma Dinkley,lets go see
Velma Dinkley,yeah very mystifying
Velma Dinkley,ill say
Velma Dinkley,gee why is it that you always pair off with daphne fred
Velma Dinkley,never mind it is a good idea you guys stay here we wanna take another look at where the guys saw that ghost
Velma Dinkley,come on
Velma Dinkley,lets take a look behind these trees
Velma Dinkley,what are these tire tracks doing back here
Velma Dinkley,right lets see where these tracks lead
Velma Dinkley,shh
Velma Dinkley,jinkies its the mayor
Velma Dinkley,i dont know but were going to find out whats in that barn
Velma Dinkley,fine you check the barn and well follow the mayor
Velma Dinkley,theres gotta be another way in here
Velma Dinkley,just a little higher
Velma Dinkley,thats great
Velma Dinkley,im fine come on
Velma Dinkley,its still warm ben
Velma Dinkley,thats the mystery
Velma Dinkley,me either
Velma Dinkley,thats no mystery
Velma Dinkley,he did there goes my cherry picker theory
Velma Dinkley,like what
Velma Dinkley,sorry about that mayor scooby and shaggy just lose it when they get scared in fact im worried that staying in oakhaven might just be too frightening and experienced for them i think we should leave
Velma Dinkley,but i need to get one more clue before the night is over then i think ill can solve the mystery of the witchs ghost before tomorrows autumns fest
Velma Dinkley,heres what were going to do
Velma Dinkley,help me i have fallen and i cant get up now yes you did it guys
Velma Dinkley,maybe i can explain i found flash powder residue where shag and scoob saw the ghost this is the device to throw the fireballs which was just watts of flash paper he got it from his daughters stage prompts
Velma Dinkley,its the cherry picker that made the ghost flie above the trees with the use of an extention device and theres the fan that created the eerie wind it took more than one person to pull of this scam isnt that right jack
Velma Dinkley,it would take someone pretty strong to hoist mr mcnight around
Velma Dinkley,that goes for all of you
Velma Dinkley,sure there had to be more people involved to make this hoax work
Velma Dinkley,shaggy you still have the shoe buckel scooby found today
Velma Dinkley,scooby can you show me exactly where you found this
Velma Dinkley,right i believe this is was left of the tree where sarah did her healing you never even noticed it because it was cut down hundreds of years ago its up to you to dig it scooby
Velma Dinkley,then how about a scooby snax
Velma Dinkley,two scooby snax
Velma Dinkley,the box
Velma Dinkley,ben that doesnt seem to be a journal at all
Velma Dinkley,you lied to me ben
Velma Dinkley,i know why because if we know what that book was we would never have helped him
Velma Dinkley,no
Velma Dinkley,ben please stop
Velma Dinkley,no
Velma Dinkley,no frankly i dont
Velma Dinkley,how could i ever liked your novels now guys grab the book
Velma Dinkley,you wont get away with this ben ravencroft

Velma Dinkley,dont worry well created a diversion for you
Velma Dinkley,how about for a whole box of scooby snacks
Velma Dinkley,good luck
Velma Dinkley,jinkies
Velma Dinkley,jinkies
Velma Dinkley,wait thorn we need your help
Velma Dinkley,we need you to read the spell to defeat sarah ravencroft
Velma Dinkley,but you said you were part wiccan
Velma Dinkley,it doesnt matter you have wiccan blood meaning you can read the spell so you can send sarah ravencroft back to where she came from
Velma Dinkley,scooby over here
Velma Dinkley,the book the book
Velma Dinkley,heres the spell its up to you thorn
Velma Dinkley,but not to a wiccan
Velma Dinkley,hurry thorn read
